Channeling: A Non-pathological Possession and Dissociative Identity Experience or Something Else?;;;Experiences Characterization Mental mechanisms Investigation Dissociative Identity Disorder;;;Channeling experiences are often compared with Dissociative Trance/Possession Disorders and Dissociative Identity Disorders and more recent diagnostic criteria presented in the DSM 5 and ICD-11. From this comparison, it emerges quite clearly that, for most cases, channeling can either be considered an exceptional non-ordinary mental experience or a non-pathological Dissociative Trance/Possession experience. If this characterization is valid, the next step is to understand the origin of channeling experiences. Are they an expression of channeler’s unconscious or voluntary mental mechanisms, or real connections with “other discarnate entities”? Given their peculiar characteristics, channeling experiences offer a unique opportunity for a scientific investigation and in particular, the origin of the information received by the channelers.;;;SC
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR);;;Disorders Mental health Clinicians Deep study;;;The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) features the most current text updates based on scientific literature with contributions from more than 200 subject matter experts. The revised version includes a new diagnosis (prolonged grief disorder), clarifying modifications to the criteria sets for more than 70 disorders, addition of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) symptom codes for suicidal behavior and nonsuicidal self-injury, and updates to descriptive text for most disorders based on extensive review of the literature. In addition, DSM-5-TR includes a comprehensive review of the impact of racism and discrimination on the diagnosis and manifestations of mental disorders. The manual will help clinicians and researchers define and classify mental disorders, which can improve diagnoses, treatment, and research.;;;SC
A qualitative exploratory analysis of channeled content;;;Research channelers Trance channeling Channeled content Thematic analysis;;;Throughout history, within numerous multicultural contexts across the globe, channeling has been expressed, practiced, revered and shunned. Broadly defined, channeling is “communication of information to or through a physically embodied human being, from a source that is said to exist on some other level or dimension of reality than the physical as we know it, and that is not from the normal mind…of the channel” (Klimo, 1998, p. 2). Despite its persistence and presence across time, the enigmatic, speculative nature of channeling creates a unique research challenge. Historically, scientific channeling research tends to minimize attention on the actual channeled material, in part due to validation constraints. The focus of this qualitative exploration was to categorize and thematically analyze content channeled during the final segment of a trance channeling study. Recorded over two days, 13 healthy adult trance channels responded to the question, "Do you have any suggestions/messages regarding the current or future channeling experiments?" Transcribed content analysis revealed seven common themes under three categories – Scientific Methodology: (1) Constraints of the current quantitative study, (2) Advancing channeling research; Channeling Processes:(3) 'How-to' of channeling, (4) Experienced processes described from the “non-physical being's” point-of-view; Open-Ended Information: (5) Philosophical – personal to global to universal, (6) Gratitude and Collaborative spirit, and (7) Personal messages for healing/growth. Themes 2 and 6 were the most represented content of messages delivered. This analysis was designed to present the experiences of the channelers, how that might be interpreted and to provide global access to the potentially valuable content.;;;SC
Anomalous information reception by research mediums demonstrated using a novel triple-blind protocol;;;Students Paired Potential identifiable Experienced Ability ;;;The results suggest that certain mediums can anomalously receive accurate information about deceased individuals. The study design effectively eliminates conventional mechanisms as well as telepathy as explanations for the information reception, but the results cannot distinguish among alternative paranormal hypotheses, such as survival of consciousness (the continued existence, separate from the body, of an individual's consciousness or personality after physical death) and super-psi (or super-ESP; retrieval of information via a psychic channel or quantum field).;;;SC
Immortal Remains: The Evidence for Life After Death;;;Superlatives Individual Alternative instead Critical comments Death Life;;;Do you believe in ghosts? Chances are you're either too willing, or not willing enough, to believe that personal consciousness survives after bodily death. Some underestimate the evidence for life after death, not realizing how impressive the most convincing cases are. Others overestimate it, rejecting alternative explanations too readily. In fact, several non-survivalist explanations―hidden or latent linguistic or artistic talents, extreme memory, even psychic abilities―are as interesting as the hypothesis of survival, and may be more plausible than their critics realize. Immortal Remains takes a fresh look at some of the most puzzling cases suggesting life after death, and considers how to tell evidence for an afterlife from evidence for exotic things (including psychic things) done by the living. Author Stephen E. Braude, who has done extensive research in parapsychology and dissociation, explores previously ignored issues about dissociation, creativity, linguistic skills, and the nature and limits of human abilities. He concludes that we have some reason, finally, for believing in life after death.;;;SC
Possession/trance phenomena.;;;Possession Trance Cultures Phenomena Normal;;;The authors delineate their most recent research into possession/trance phenomena in various cultures. They show that possession/trance phenomena are normal in many cultures (including some Western subcultures), but that there are also abnormal forms of possession/trance in those same cultures. The authors argue that pathological forms of possession/ trance phenomena have two features. First, they cause dysfunction or distress and are associated with maladjustment. Second, they occur in a way that is not part of a culturally-accepted practice. The authors propose that both normal and pathological forms of possession/trance phenomena are rooted in a predisposition, probably biological, to dissociate, be suggestible, and/or have unusual experiences. Finally, they emphasize the very important fact that, in non-Western cultures, the most common dissociative disorders involve trance and/or possession.;;;SC
Trance, Functional Psychosis, and Culture.;;;Hypothesis Psychoses Culturally sctructured Reactions Environmental stress;;;This paper discusses the hypothesis that the symptoms of functional psychoses can be caused by culturally structured spontaneous trances that may be reactions to environmental stress and psychological trauma. Findings are reviewed of anthropological studies of meditative trance experiences in Indian yogis characterized by divided consciousness (dissociation), religious auditory and visual hallucinations, and beliefs in their own spiritual powers. An explanation of the psychological mechanisms of meditative trance is also provided, highlighting trance-related alteration of consciousness within an Indian cultural context. It is suggested that the psychological mechanisms of meditative trance are similar in structure to spontaneous trances underlying the symptoms of some functional psychoses. Findings from cross-cultural studies are also reviewed, highlighting the effects of culture on the symptoms, indigenous diagnoses; treatments, and outcomes of functional psychoses. In non-Western cultures, transient functional psychoses with complete recovery are 10 times more common than in Western cultures. It is suggested that egocentrism and a loss of spiritual explanations for psychosis in Western cultures constructs a clinical situation in which persons with functional psychoses are treated for a biogenetic (incurable) brain disease rather than a curable spiritual illness. This difference in cultural belief systems leads to poorer outcomes for Western patients compared to non-Western patients. Recognizing cultural differences in symptoms, indigenous diagnoses, and treatment for functional psychoses can help explain the dramatic cross-cultural differences in outcome. ;;;SC
Electrocortical activity associated with subjective communication with the deceased;;;Communication Physical mediumship Experienced Societies Culture Pathology;;;During advanced meditative practices, unusual perceptions can arise including the sense of receiving information about unknown people who are deceased. As with meditation, this mental state of communication with the deceased involves calming mental chatter and becoming receptive to subtle feelings and sensations. Psychometric and brain electrophysiology data were collected from six individuals who had previously reported accurate information about deceased individuals under double-blind conditions. Each experimental participant performed two tasks with eyes closed. In the first task, the participant was given only the first name of a deceased person and asked 25 questions. After each question, the participant was asked to silently perceive information relevant to the question for 20 s and then respond verbally. Responses were transcribed and then scored for accuracy by individuals who knew the deceased persons. Of the four mediums whose accuracy could be evaluated, three scored significantly above chance (p < 0.03). The correlation between accuracy and brain activity during the 20 s of silent mediumship communication was significant in frontal theta for one participant (p < 0.01). In the second task, participants were asked to experience four mental states for 1 min each: (1) thinking about a known living person, (2) listening to a biography, (3) thinking about an imaginary person, and (4) interacting mentally with a known deceased person. Each mental state was repeated three times. Statistically significant differences at p < 0.01 after correction for multiple comparisons in electrocortical activity among the four conditions were obtained in all six participants, primarily in the gamma band (which might be due to muscular activity). These differences suggest that the impression of communicating with the deceased may be a distinct mental state distinct from ordinary thinking or imagination.;;;SC
Intuitive Assessment of Mortality Based on Facial Characteristics: Behavioral, Electrocortical, and Machine Learning Analyses;;;Person's photograph Categories Stimulus Electrocortical recordings Characteristics Conducted;;;Studies of various characteristics of the human face indicate that it contains a wealth of information about health status. Most studies involve objective measurement of facial features as correlated with historical health information. But some individuals also claim to be adept at intuitively gauging mortality based solely upon a quick glance at a person's photograph. To test this claim, we invited 12 such individuals to see if they could tell if a person was alive or dead based solely on a brief examination of his or her photograph. All photos used in the experiment were transformed into a uniform gray scale and counterbalanced across eight categories as follows: gender, age, gaze direction, glasses, head position, smile, hair color, and image resolution. Participants examined 404 photographs displayed on a computer monitor, one photo at a time, each shown for a maximum of 8seconds. Half of the individuals in the photos were deceased, and half were alive at the time the experiment was conducted. Participants were asked to indicate if they thought the person in a photo was living or deceased by pressing an appropriate button. Overall, mean accuracy on this task was 53.6%, where 50% was expected by chance (P = .005, two tail). Statistically significant accuracy was independently obtained in 5 of the 12 participants. We also collected 32-channel electrocortical recordings and observed a robust difference between images of deceased individuals correctly vs. incorrectly classified in the early event related potential at 100ms post-stimulus onset. We then applied machine learning techniques to classify the photographs based on 11 image characteristics; both random forest and logistic regression machine learning approaches were used, and both classifiers failed to achieve accuracy above chance level. Our results suggest that some individuals can intuitively assess mortality based on some as-yet unknown features of the face.;;;SC
Across Cultural Boundaries: Psychophysiological Responses, Absorption, and Dissociation Comparison Between Brazilian Spiritists and Advanced Meditators;;;Mediumship Channeling psychophysiology Umbanda Kardecismo Candombleâ Ramtha;;;A psychophysiological study was conducted with two Brazilian claimant mediums and a non-medium living in Recife, Brazil and 7 North American advanced meditators from the esoteric school, Ramthaâ€™s School of Enlightenment, located in Yelm, Washington. Results revealed specific incongruence in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central autonomic nervous system (CNS). For Brazilians, there was a general reduction of sympathetic PNS vasoconstriction and increased muscle tension (EMG) during the imagined incorporation of spirits, and an increase in (EMG) and alpha wave percentage (EEG); both were paradoxical. Increase in frontal EMG while imagining spirit incorporation is consistent with a hypothesis of increased muscle tension possibly driven by intrusive cognitions and/or affect; however, the mediums reported feeling calm, not agitated. The non-medium control showed a large increase in EEG alpha wave percentage and decreased EMG in the eyes closed conditions. The mediumsâ€™ imagination condition was discrepant from what is typical during an eyes closed imagination condition, and EMG and EEG were positively correlated contrasting research findings from other studies revealing a negative correlation. This supports previous findings that physiological incongruence are frequent outcomes of individuals claiming "mediumistic" abilities; they are described as living episodically in two worlds (i.e., critical, rational, and practical; expansion and deepening of fantasy and emotional reactivity). As such, medium/mediumistic-like practitioners may be "at risk" for psychosomatic illnesses, but these descriptors do not particularly apply to the Brazilian control showing no noticeable incongruence. The advanced Ramtha meditators were not tested with an EEG, but also showed sympathetic activation during the meditation session and reported minimal/none negative affect. Incongruence between CNS and ANS are not unusual among spiritual practitioners, and other studies have noted sympathetic activation during meditation styles that use cognitive faculties and/or accelerated breathing (voluntary hyperventilation) techniques. The findings suggest medium/mediumistic-like practitioners may need to create â€œbuffersâ€ to maintain physical and emotional well being.;;;SC
Sensing the presence of gods and spirits across cultures and faiths;;;Culture Comunication Interdisciplinary program clinical-style Industrialized Phenomenology;;;Hearing the voice of God, feeling the presence of the dead, being possessed by a demonic spirit—such events are among the most remarkable human sensory experiences. They change lives and in turn shape history. Why do some people report experiencing such events while others do not? We argue that experiences of spiritual presence are facilitated by cultural models that represent the mind as “porous,” or permeable to the world, and by an immersive orientation toward inner life that allows a person to become “absorbed” in experiences. In four studies with over 2,000 participants from many religious traditions in the United States, Ghana, Thailand, China, and Vanuatu, porosity and absorption played distinct roles in determining which people, in which cultural settings, were most likely to report vivid sensory experiences of what they took to be gods and spirits.;;;SC
Dissociation and Dissociative Disorders: Challenging Conventional Wisdom;;;Dissociation dissociative disorder dissociative identity disorder trauma;;;Conventional wisdom holds that dissociation is a coping mechanism triggered by exposure to intense stressors. Drawing on recent research from multiple laboratories, we challenge this prevailing posttraumatic model of dissociation and dissociative disorders. Proponents of this model hold that dissociation and dissociative disorders are associated with (a) intense objective stressors (e.g., childhood trauma), (b) serious cognitive deficits that impede processing of emotionally laden information, and (c) an avoidant information-processing style characterized by a tendency to forget painful memories. We review findings that contradict these widely accepted assumptions and argue that a sociocognitive model better accounts for the extant data. We further propose a perspective on dissociation based on a recently established link between a labile sleep–wake cycle and memory errors, cognitive failures, problems in attentional control, and difficulties in distinguishing fantasy from reality. We conclude that this perspective may help to reconcile the posttraumatic and sociocognitive models of dissociation and dissociative disorders.;;;SC
Differential Diagnosis Between Non-pathological Psychotic and Spiritual Experiences and Mental Disorders: A Contribution from Latin American Studies to the ICD-11. ;;;Psychotic disorders Spirituality Diagnosis differential Classification;;;To review research articles in psychiatry and psychology involving Latin American populations and/or produced by Latin American scholars to investigate the differential diagnosis between spiritual/anomalous experiences and mental disorders in order to contribute to the validity of the International Classification of Diseases towards its 11th edition in this area. METHOD: We searched electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and SciELO) using relevant keywords (possession, trance, religious experience, spiritual experience, latin, Brazil) for articles with original psychiatric and psychological data on spiritual experiences. We also analyzed the references of the articles found and contacted authors for additional references and data. RESULTS: There is strong evidence that psychotic and anomalous experiences are frequent in the general population and that most of them are not related to psychotic disorders. Often, spiritual experiences involve non-pathological dissociative and psychotic experiences. Although spiritual experiences are not usually related to mental disorders, they may cause transient distress and are commonly reported by psychotic patients. CONCLUSION: We propose some features that suggest the non-pathological nature of a spiritual experience: lack of suffering, lack of social or functional impairment, compatibility with the patient's cultural background and recognition by others, absence of psychiatric comorbidities, control over the experience, and personal growth over time.;;;SC
Comparison of Brazilian Spiritist Mediumship and Dissociative Identity Disorder;;;Similarities differences Dissociative identity disorder ;;;We studied the similarities and differences between Brazilian Spiritistic mediums and North American dissociative identity disorder (DID) patients. Twenty-four mediums selected among different Spiritistic organizations in São Paulo, Brazil, were interviewed using the Dissociative Disorder Interview Schedule, and their responses were compared with those of DID patients described in the literature. The results from Spiritistic mediums were similar to published data on DID patients only with respect to female prevalence and high frequency of Schneiderian first-rank symptoms. As compared with individuals with DID, the mediums differed in having better social adjustment, lower prevalence of mental disorders, lower use of mental health services, no use of antipsychotics, and lower prevalence of histories of physical or sexual childhood abuse, sleepwalking, secondary features of DID, and symptoms of borderline personality. Thus, mediumship differed from DID in having better mental health and social adjustment, and a different clinical profile.;;;SC
Anomalous information reception by mediums: A meta-analysis of the scientific evidence;;;Mediumship Anomalous information Sitter Meta-analysis Survival hypothesis;;;Background and purpose Mediumship is the ostensible phenomenon of human-mediated communication between deceased and living persons. In this paper, we perform a meta-analysis of all available modern experimental evidence, specifically from 2001 to December 2019, investigating the accuracy of apparently anomalously received information provided by mediums about deceased individuals. Methods 14 papers passed our selection criteria, for a total of 18 experiments. Both Bayesian and frequentist random effects models were used to estimate the aggregate effect size across studies.;;;SC
Characteristics of English-speaking trance channelers;;;Trance channeling Mediumship Anomalous information reception Spirit possession;;;Historical records suggest that channeling has existed globally, in a variety of cultures, for thousands of years, and recent research suggests that channeling is more prevalent than most people realize. The present study used an online survey to explore mental health factors, personality characteristics, subjective experiences, and the impact of channeling on 83 participants who self-identified as trance channelers. Most participants endorsed being spiritual but not religious as adults, and on average the channeling experiences began at middle age. The majority of participants did not report pathological levels of dissociative or psychotic symptoms, anxiety or depression. Compared to relevant norms, participants reported similar scores on most personality factors, psychological absorption and empathy. Participants’ average scores on emotional and environmental sensitivity corresponded to being designated as sensory-processing sensitives. Participants reported high levels of noetic beliefs and experiences, particularly beliefs in life after death, non-local consciousness, and telepathy. Most participants reported that their channeling process is willful and consensual and that they are consciously aware of the channeling state while it occurs. The majority of participants also reported a positive impact of channeling on their lives. Lower psychotic symptoms, older age when the trance channeling experiences began, and higher sensitivity scores predicted a greater positive impact of trance on participants’ lives. Given that trance channeling has played a role in religious and spiritual traditions around the world throughout history, the present study provides an important exploration of the trance channeling phenomenon.;;;SC
How Place Matters for Migrants’ Socio-Legal Experiences: Local Reasoning about the Law and the Importance of Becoming a “Moral Insider”;;;Migrants Interaction Local residents Law Morally;;;In this article, we argue that migrants’ socio-legal experiences in the places where they settle are formed in interaction with how local residents morally reason about the law. Specifically, based on nine months of fieldwork in an impoverished Italian town, we argue that aligning with how local residents approach the law, including when they justify disobeying it, matters a great deal for migrants’ lives. Focusing on the workings of a reception center for asylum seekers, we first show how local residents regularly support various violations of the law by referring to alternative—and in their view higher—principles of justice. Migrants find themselves caught up in these local moral tensions, at times even becoming involved in illegal practices unbeknownst to them. We then show how migrants’ reactions to the marginality of the law in the town affect their access to local support. Those who align with local nonlegal moral norms obtain access to opportunities, while those who in similar situations invoke the primacy of legality tend to experience ostracization. By investigating the dynamic role of local moralities in situated interaction, this article contributes to both the sociology of morality and the sociology of migration. It shows how moral decision-making processes can and should be studied in their collective dimension, beyond individual-level experiments. Further, with its focus on processes of moral (mis)alignment, it allows us to grasp how place matters for migrants’ lives beyond overly general notions of ‘hostile’ versus ‘hospitable’ localities.;;;SC
Legal Consciousness of Undocumented Latinos: Fear and Stigma as Barriers to Claims-Making for First- and 1.5-Generation Immigrants;;;Immigrants Experiences Population Adults live Daily lifes;;;This article examines the legal consciousness and incorporation experiences of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Although this population may be disaggregated along several axes, one central distinction among them is their age at migration. Those who migrated as adults live out their daily lives in different social contexts than those who migrated as children. Therefore, although all undocumented immigrants are legally banned, their identities, sense of belonging, and interpretation of their status vary. Based on ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews of Latino undocumented immigrants from 2001 to 2010, I examine how illegality is experienced differently by social position. The findings suggest that the role of life-stage at migration and work-versus-school contexts importantly inform immigrants' legal consciousness. Fear predominates in the legal consciousness of first-generation undocumented immigrants, while the legal consciousness of the 1.5 generation is more heavily infused with stigma. Fear and stigma are both barriers to claims-making, but they may affect undocumented immigrants' potential for collective mobilization in different ways.;;;SC
Illegality, motherhood, and place: Undocumented Latinas making meaning and negotiating daily life;;;Context of reception Illegalily Immigrant itegration Legal violence Place Undocumented motherhood Multidimensional agency;;;Federal immigration policies powerfully shape immigrants' and their families' lives, but the consequences are uneven across place. Taking seriously the notion of place as socially constructed, this article draws from two qualitative studies, one in the new rural immigrant destination of Southwest, Montana, and the other in the traditional urban destination of Los Angeles, California, to examine how undocumented immigrants navigate daily life in the US. In the face of legal violence and place-specific forms of exploitation, mothers exert strained forms of agency through access to or creative redefinitions of local work, social services, and networks. They make meaning of place as best as they can through the lens of motherhood, regardless of how they achieve financial or emotional stability for their children. The analysis reveals that illegality intersects with dynamic characteristics of place to produce varying experiences of exploitation and constrained agency centered often on motherhood.;;;SC
How cities shape refugee centres: ‘deservingness’ and ‘good aid’ in a Sicilian town;;;Hostility suffering moral economy asylum Italy;;;While scholars have devoted increasing attention to the dynamics at play within refugee centres, analyses have often been driven by the ‘exceptionality’ of these institutions, overlooking the ways in which what happens inside the centres is largely connected to what goes on outside of them. Building on ethnographic fieldwork in a Sicilian refugee centre and the surrounding town, this paper investigates the extent to which economic, historical and political configurations inform how local actors conceptualise aid and how they interact with refugees on a daily basis. Overall, the study found that both centre workers and the general population mobilise moral arguments that can only be understood in light of dynamics that are external to the centre itself. These findings ultimately point to the extent to which state-level dysfunctions influence popular images of what a ‘deserving’ refugee might look like as well as local understandings of the ‘right way’ of providing help.;;;SC
Legal Consciousness Reconsidered;;;Legal consciousness relationality identity power mobilization;;;Legal consciousness is a vibrant research field attracting growing numbers of scholars worldwide. Yet differing assumptions about aims and methods have generated vigorous debate, typically resulting from a failure to recognize that three different clusters of scholars—identified here as the Identity, Hegemony, and Mobilization schools—are pursuing different goals and deploying the concept of legal consciousness in different ways. Scholarship associated with these three schools demonstrates that legal consciousness is actually a flexible paradigm with multiple applications rather than a monolithic approach. Furthermore, a new generation of scholars has energized the field in recent years, focusing on marginalized peoples and non-Western settings. Through their findings, and as a result of broader trends across the social sciences, relational legal consciousness has taken on greater importance. Legal consciousness research should be imagined on a continuum ranging from individualistic conceptualizations of thought and action to interactive, co-constitutive approaches.;;;SC
Metropolitan context and immigrant rights experiences: DACA awareness and support in Houston;;;Undocumented immigrantsfederal immigration polic yDACA immigrant rights metropolitan context Houston;;;This paper examines how metropolitan contexts of reception shaped immigrants’ experiences of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Drawing on interviews with 32 DACA applicants in metro Houston, we analyze how respondents thought about DACA in relation to their safety and sense of belonging, as well as their educational pathways and professional aspirations. We also examine how they interacted with different local actors and institutions – schools, consulates, civic organizations, and private attorneys and notarios – as they sought help in applying for DACA. We find that undocumented youth in the progressive and more welcoming urban core of metro Houston articulated motivations for applying for DACA that were similar to their counterparts residing in the less diverse and much more heavily policed anti-immigrant suburbs and rural areas ringing the city. Yet DACA applicants in outlying areas, where there were fewer civic organizations and more transportation challenges, found it especially challenging to get DACA application assistance. As a result, they more often turned to expensive attorneys and notarios for help. These findings underscore the need to think of urban, suburban, and rural contexts of reception in relation, and not in isolation, of each other when considering immigrants’ experiences of federal immigration policies.;;;SC
Socialising place attachment: place, social memory and embodied affordances;;;place attachment belonging social memory relational embodied;;;The significance of place attachment for later life has been convincingly demonstrated. Scholars have offered useful models that help account for the depth of feeling bound up in place attachment in later life, how this attachment is achieved, and its relevance for belonging and identity. To date, however, this focus has largely been on the individual level of experience. This article draws on sociological and anthropological perspectives to consider how place attachment is forged and experienced in dynamic interaction with other entities and other processes: how place attachment is also a collective, relational and embodied process, caught up and experienced via social memory practices and sensorial, bodily knowledge. This resonates with and contributes to the ‘relational turn’ which has attracted burgeoning interest in the larger home disciplines of sociology, human geography and anthropology, and reciprocally helps them extend and build their interaction with critical ageing studies. In making this argument, I draw on two periods of anthropological, ethnographic participant-observation that I conducted in a semi-rural village in the former coalfields in South Yorkshire, England.;;;SC
Pragmatism and Ethnomethodology;;;Pragmatist Empirical explored recovery Ethnomethodology practices;;;Three features of pragmatist thought remain empirically underdeveloped or insufficiently explored: its call for a return to experience or recovery of concrete practices; its idea that obstacles in experience give rise to efforts at creative problem-solving; and its understanding of language in use, including conversational interaction, as an order of empirical practices in and through which problem-solving efforts are undertaken and social order ongoingly and collaboratively accomplished. Our aim in this article is to show that there exists a long-standing, theoretically informed, and empirically rich research tradition in which these pragmatist themes are further developed, albeit in ways the originators might have foreseen only in dimly programmatic form. This research tradition is ethnomethodology. We present in bold strokes the classical pragmatist ideas of Peirce, James, Mead, Dewey, plus Addams, focusing on the three themes mentioned above. We show how Garfinkel’s work surpasses even that of the pragmatists in developing the larger implications and promise of those themes. We demonstrate how ethnomethodological studies of work and science and conversation analysis, respectively, continue as well to develop the original pragmatist impulse in unsuspected ways. Finally, we step back from this account to ponder the broader significance of the connections we have explored between pragmatism and ethnomethodology.;;;SC
LAW AND MORAL JUSTIFICATION;;;law justification authority justice;;;Many prominent legal philosophers believe that law makes some type of moral claim in virtue of its nature. Although the law is not an intelligent agent, the attribution of a claim to law does not need to be as mysterious as some theorists believe. It means that law-making and law- applying acts are intelligible only in the light of a certain presupposition, even if a lawmaker or a law-applier subjectively disbelieves the content of that presupposition. In this paper, I aim to clarify what type of moral claim would be suitable for law if law were to make a claim to be morally justified. I then argue that legal practice is perfectly intelligible without moral presuppositions - that is, that the law does not necessarily make moral claims.;;;SC
A contribution to the critique of moral reason;;;critical thinking moral anthropology moral economy morality;;;Responding to Carlo Caduff’s comments on an earlier paper of mine provides me with the opportunity to refine my defense and illustration of moral anthropology. After having recalled that my personal encounter with moralities and ethics was of the kind of Monsieur Jourdain’s discovery of prose, rather than a deliberate effort to apply moral philosophy to social science, I attempt to clarify my positioning in terms of critical thinking and my reformulation of the concept of moral economies, using my research on the intolerable and on humanitarianism. My explicit intention is to go beyond or rather, more modestly, to veer away from the alternative between the Durkheim-Kant legacy and the Foucault-Aristotle tradition, and from the dialectic between morality as code and ethics as freedom. It is to explore two epistemological frontiers: one related to the place occupied by the anthropologist, which I suggest should be on the threshold of rather than inside or outside Plato’s cave; the other one linked to the separation of a moral and ethical matter from the social gangue of human lives, which I find problematic because of the loss of history and politics it implies. I contend that both frontiers engage what it means and implies to be doing social science in the contemporary world.;;;SC
Legal Consciousness in Action: Lay People and Accountability in the Jury Room;;;Legal consciousness Experience Interpret Law Natural conversation;;;This paper argues that lay people’s legal consciousness, defined as how they experience and interpret the law and legal meanings, can be studied by observing natural conversation. It proposes a framework that analyzes the contexts when law is invoked to account for social behavior, which enables examination of individuals’ perceptions of law through their utilization of and reactions to it. This framework is applied to recordings of a jury deliberation, an ideal setting due to its institutionally-controlled conditions. The analysis demonstrates that jurors wield law as a conversational resource to create distinctions between legitimate and illegitimate conduct based upon their endogenous understandings of these boundaries. The invocation of law is an important element of the deliberation because it permits jurors to enforce these distinctions and understand their completed duties as aligning with the legal system’s ideals. This paper also discusses the ability of this framework to study the law’s influence in other social institutions, as well as those institutions’ own “consciousness.”;;;SC
The New Sociology of Morality;;;morality moral systems sociological theory;;;Sociology was once integral to the scientific study of morality, but its explicit focus has waned over the past half-century. This article calls for greater sociological engagement in order to speak to the resurgence of the study of morality in cognate fields. We identify important treatments of morality, some of which are not explicitly so, and identify those treatments that build a distinctly sociological focus on morality: room for culturally divergent understandings of its content, a focus on antecedent social factors that shape it, and a concern with ecologically valid explorations of its social importance.;;;SC
Why do People Comply with the Law? Legitimacy and the Influence of Legal Institutions ;;;Analysin data People Law Legal Institutions ;;;This paper extends Tyler’s procedural justice model of public compliance with the law. Analysing data from a national probability sample of adults in England and Wales, we present a new conceptualization of legitimacy based on not just the recognition of power, but also the justification of power. We find that people accept the police’s right to dictate appropriate behaviour not only when they feel a duty to obey officers, but also when they believe that the institution acts according to a shared moral purpose with citizens. Highlighting a number of different routes by which institutions can influence citizen behaviour, our broader normative model provides a better framework for explaining why people are willing to comply with the law.;;;SC
Migrants' Relationship with Law in the Host Country: Exploring the Role of Legal Culture;;;Migration Legal Pluralism Legal Culture Legal Consciousness Agency Transnationalism;;;This paper asks how to study migrants' relationship with the legal system upon arrival in the host country? Concentrating on the issues of plurality, it articulates different ways of explaining migrants' legal adaptations to the new legal environment. To clarify the fragmented debates I organise the approaches around the relative importance of the main analytical perspectives: legal assimilation, legal pluralism and legal consciousness/culture. I critically examine the assimilationist approach and demonstrate how the alternative perspectives are both an advance and a critique of it. The paper concludes that for studying migrants' legal adaptations the relevant question between legal pluralism and legal consciousness/culture approaches should not be one of ‘either/or’ but ‘how much’ or ‘to what extent’, depending on the populations under scrutiny. They both contribute to new ways in which ‘law’ is conceptualised that have implications for the study of legal orders as a whole.;;;SC
Toward a Comparative Sociology of Valuation and Evaluation;;;worth value evaluative practices social processes heterarchies;;;This review discusses North American and European research from the sociology of valuation and evaluation (SVE), a research topic that has attracted considerable attention in recent years. The goal is to bring various bodies of work into conversation with one another in order to stimulate more cumulative theory building. This is accomplished by focusing on (a) subprocesses such as categorization and legitimation, (b) the conditions that sustain heterarchies, and (c) valuation and evaluative practices. The article reviews these literatures and provides directions for a future research agenda.;;;SC
The Social Production of Latin@ Visibilities and Invisibilities: Geographies of Power in Small Town America;;;sociospatial dynamics unfolding Social Production;;;This paper explores the sociospatial dynamics unfolding in Perry, a rural Iowa town that has been facing rapid change since the 1990s due to growing Latin@ settlement. We focus on what we call the social production of Latin@ visibilities and invisibilities: spatialized practices by individuals, families, communities, and institutions that render different Latin@ groups visible or invisible, with repercussions for survival, community integration, and political praxis. We discuss the border within as an extension of border politics and borderlands rhetorics to the US “heartland”, and how the entrenchment of a regime of deportability creates racialized and gendered conditions for the in/visibility of Latin@ immigrants and Latin@s more broadly. We conclude by considering some of the theoretical and political implications of our analysis for such geographies of power and the social relations, locations, and discourses that constitute and are constituted by them.;;;SC
Multidimensional Poverty Index with Dependence-Based Weights;;;Multidimensional perception Poverty phenomenon Dependence Perception;;;An important aspect of the multidimensional perception of poverty phenomenon is the dependence among the underlying indicators. However, the commonly applied approaches to multidimensional poverty assessment do not capture this interdependence. In this paper we propose a new multidimensional poverty index accounting for the dependence and innovate over the weighting approach. The weighting method proposed here incorporates the copula-based rank dependence among well-being dimensions and contains necessary normative parameters. In particular, the latter includes the elasticity of substitution among dimensions and the belief-adjusting parameter, which specifies the direction of relation between the dependence and the weights. The results of poverty evaluation in the selected European countries suggest that multidimensional poverty is driven not only by the individual shortfalls, but also by the degree of interdependence among well-being indicators. Moreover, multidimensional poverty is relatively higher, if dimensional weights are in direct proportion to the dependence compared to the cases of inverse relation and equal weighting. Considering the novel weighting approach, this paper contributes to the literature on composite indicators by suggesting a channel to enclose the dependence structure in the multidimensional poverty index.;;;SC
Counting and multidimensional poverty measurement;;;Multidimensional poverty measurement Capability approach Identification FGT measures Decomposability Ordinal variables;;;This paper proposes a new methodology for multidimensional poverty measurement consisting of an identification method ρk that extends the traditional intersection and union approaches, and a class of poverty measures Mα. Our identification step employs two forms of cutoff: one within each dimension to determine whether a person is deprived in that dimension, and a second across dimensions that identifies the poor by ‘counting’ the dimensions in which a person is deprived. The aggregation step employs the FGT measures, appropriately adjusted to account for multidimensionality. The axioms are presented as joint restrictions on identification and the measures, and the methodology satisfies a range of desirable properties including decomposability. The identification method is particularly well suited for use with ordinal data, as is the first of our measures, the adjusted headcount ratio M0. We present some dominance results and an interpretation of the adjusted headcount ratio as a measure of unfreedom. Examples from the US and Indonesia illustrate our methodology.;;;SC
Multidimensional Analysis of Deprivation and Fragility Patterns of Migrants in Lombardy, Using Partially Ordered Sets and Self-Organizing Maps;;;Multidimensional fuzzy analysys Poverty Migrants Families;;;In this paper, we present a multidimensional fuzzy analysis of the levels and the patterns of poverty and social fragility of migrants’ families, in the Italian region of Lombardy, in year 2014. Migrants’ poverty emerges as a complex trait, better described as a stratification of nuanced patterns than in black and white terms; Lombard migrants are in fact affected, to different extents, by “a diffused sharing of deprivation facets” and cannot be trivially split into deprived and non-deprived. The paper employs innovative data analysis tools from the Theory of Partially Ordered Sets; compared to mainstream monetary approaches, this leads to more realistic estimates of poverty diffusion and eliminates some well-known biases of standard evaluation procedures, providing strong support to the use of partial order concepts and tools in social evaluation studies.;;;SC
The Comparison of Multi-Dimensioned Distributions of Economic Status;;;Multi-Dimensioned indicators Issues Several dimensions;;;The literature on inequality measurement has been largely concerned with single-dimensioned indicators. This paper explores some of the issues which arise when there are several dimensions to inequality, and these are not readily reduced to a single index, concentrating particularly on the two-dimensioned case. We make use of results on multi-variate stochastic dominance in portfolio theory, extending these and applying them to the measurement of inequality. The use of the dominance conditions is illustrated by an application to the international distribution of income and life expectancy.;;;SC
Nonparametric estimation of copula-based measures of multivariate association from contingency tables;;;Spearman's rho Kendall's taucopula density aggregated observations ordinal observations checkerboard copula standard extension copula;;;Nonparametric estimation of copula-based measures of multivariate association in a continuous random vector X=(X1, …, Xd) is usually based on complete continuous data. In many practical applications, however, these types of data are not readily available; instead aggregated ordinal observations are given, for example, ordinal ratings based on a latent continuous scale. This article introduces a purely nonparametric and data-driven estimator of the unknown copula density and the corresponding copula based on multivariate contingency tables. Estimators for multivariate Spearman's rho and Kendall's tau are based thereon. The properties of these estimators in samples of medium and large size are evaluated in a simulation study. An increasing bias can be observed along with an increasing degree of association between the components. As it is to be expected, the bias is severely influenced by the amount of information available. Additionally, the influence of sample size is only marginal. We further give an empirical illustration based on daily returns of five German stocks.;;;SC
Multidimensional Poverty and Material Deprivation with Discrete Data;;;Multidimensional poverty Ordinal variables Material Deprivation;;;We propose a characterization of a popular index of multidimensional poverty which, as a special case, generates a measure of material deprivation. This index is the weighted sum of the functioning failures. The important feature of the variables that may be relevant for poverty assessments is that they are discrete in nature. Thus, poverty measures based on continuous variables are not suitable in this setting and the assumption of a discrete domain is mandatory. We apply the measure to European Union member states where the concept of material deprivation was initiated and illustrate how its recommendations differ from those obtained from poverty measures based exclusively on income considerations.;;;SC
The Measurement of Multidimensional Poverty;;;Measurement Multidimensional Poverty Consumption expenditures;;;Many authors have insisted on the necessity of defining poverty as a multidimensional concept rather than relying on income or consumption expenditures per capita. Yet, not much has actually been done to include the various dimensions of deprivation into the practical definition and measurement of poverty. Existing attempts along that direction consist of aggregating various attributes into a single index through some arbitrary function and defining a poverty line and associated poverty measures on the basis of that index. This is merely redefining more generally the concept of poverty, which then essentially remains a one dimensional concept. The present paper suggests that an alternative way to take into account the multi-dimensionality of poverty is to specify a poverty line for each dimension of poverty and to consider that a person is poor if he/she falls below at least one of these various lines. The paper then explores how to combine these various poverty lines and associated one-dimensional gaps into multidimensional poverty measures. An application of these measures to the rural population in Brazil is also given with poverty defined on income and education.;;;SC
Copula-based measurement of dependence between dimensions of well-being;;;Dependence multidimensional measures Social welfare;;;Most multidimensional measures of social welfare first aggregate the outcomes across the individuals dimension by dimension and then, in the second step, aggregate the resulting summary statistics across the dimensions. This approach is blind to the dependence between dimensions of well-being, that is, the extent to which the positions of the individuals in the different dimensions of well-being are aligned. To quantify what lies behind this blind spot, this article introduces a copula-based incomplete ordering of dependence and two classes of consistent dependence measures. The importance of allowing for dependence in rankings of social welfare is illustrated with a Russian data set between 1995 and 2005.;;;SC
Maximum likelihood estimation of mixed C-vines with application to exchange rates;;;copulas C-vine maximum likelihood estimation pair-copula construction US-exchange rates;;;Multivariate copulas are commonly used in economics, finance and risk management. They allow for very flexible dependency structures, even though they are applied to transformed financial data after marginal time dependencies are removed. This is necessary to facilitate statistical parameter estimation. In this paper we consider a very flexible class of mixed C-vines, which allows the variables to be ordered according to their influence. Vines are built from bivariate copulas only and the term ‘mixed’ refers to allowing the pair-copula family to be chosen individually for each term. In addition there are many C-vine structure specifications possible and therefore we propose a novel data driven sequential selection procedure, which selects both the C-vine structure and its attached pair-copula families with parameters. After the model selection maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the parameters is facilitated using the sequential estimates as starting values. An extensive simulation study shows a satisfactory performance of ML estimates in small samples. Finally an application involving US-exchange rates demonstrates the need for mixed C-vine models.;;;SC
A new class of composite indicators for measuring well-being at the local level: An application to the Equitable and Sustainable Well-being (BES) of the Italian Provinces;;;Composite indicators Aggregation procedure Equitable and Sustainable Well-being Local well-being;;;The aim of this paper is to propose a class of composite indicators for measuring well-being at the local level, which takes into account the variability between and within the local units. Although we believe that well-being is a multidimensional concept and cannot be reduced to a single measure, we also stress the importance of aggregating the information of several well-being indicators into a reduced number of composite indicators, one for each well-being domain, which play a crucial role in policymaking and benchmarking.;;;SC
Weights in Multidimensional Indices of Wellbeing: An Overview;;;Composite indicator Multidimensional wellbeing index Weights;;;Multidimensional indices are becoming increasingly important instruments to assess the wellbeing of societies. They move beyond the focus on a single indicator and yet they are easy to present and communicate. A crucial step in the construction of a multidimensional index of wellbeing is the selection of the relative weights for the different dimensions. The aim of this article is to study the role of these weights and to critically survey eight different approaches to set them. We categorize the approaches in three classes: data-driven, normative, and hybrid weighting, and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks.;;;SC
What If We Voted on the Weights of a Multidimensional Well-Being Index? An Illustration with Flemish Data;;;Multidimensional Well-Being Index Widespread consensus;;;There is a widespread consensus that well-being is a multidimensional notion. To quantify multidimensional well-being, information on the relative weights of the different dimensions is essential. There is, however, considerable disagreement in the literature on the most appropriate weighting scheme to use. Making use of a recent data set for Flanders, we calculate and compare various common weighting schemes, which are uniformly applied to all individuals. We find that a policymaker would identify different groups of individuals as being worst off depending on the scheme that is chosen. In order to compare and evaluate the weighting schemes, we simulate the support each scheme would get in a voting procedure. Weighting schemes that obtain higher support reflect better the priorities of the respondents and suffer less from the problem of paternalism that is inherent to any common weighting scheme.;;;SC

We also provide a hill characterization of empirical copulas in a general framework. Bibliography: 30 titles.;;;SC
MEASURING MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY: AN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF VARIOUS APPROACHES;;;Proverty  Systematic comparision Multidimensional analysis Theory fuzzy;;;This paper makes a systematic comparison of four approaches to multidimensional poverty analysis based respectively on the theory of fuzzy sets, information theory, efficiency analysis and axiomatic derivations of poverty indices. The database was the 1995 Israeli Census that provided information on the ownership of various durable goods. There appears to be a fair degree of agreement between the various multidimensional poverty indices concerning the identification of the poor households. The four approaches have also shown that poverty decreases with the schooling level of the head of the household, first decreases and then increases with his/her age and with the size of the household. Poverty is higher when the head of the household is single and lower when he/she is married, lowest when the head of the household is Jewish and highest when he/she is Muslim. Poverty is also higher among households whose head immigrated in recent years, does not work or lives in Jerusalem. These observations were made on the basis of logit regressions. This impact on poverty of many of the variables is not very different from the one that is observed when poverty measurement is based only on the income or the total expenditures of the households.;;;SC
On the Methodological Framework of Composite Indices: A Review of the Issues of Weighting, Aggregation, and Robustness;;;Methodological Framework straightforward task Research areas;;;In recent times, composite indicators have gained astounding popularity in a wide variety of research areas. Their adoption by global institutions has further captured the attention of the media and policymakers around the globe, and their number of applications has surged ever since. This increase in their popularity has solicited a plethora of methodological contributions in response to the substantial criticism surrounding their underlying framework. In this paper, we put composite indicators under the spotlight, examining the wide variety of methodological approaches in existence. In this way, we offer a more recent outlook on the advances made in this field over the past years. Despite the large sequence of steps required in the construction of composite indicators, we focus particularly on two of them, namely weighting and aggregation. We find that these are where the paramount criticism appears and where a promising future lies. Finally, we review the last step of the robustness analysis that follows their construction, to which less attention has been paid despite its importance. Overall, this study aims to provide both academics and practitioners in the field of composite indices with a synopsis of the choices available alongside their recent advances.;;;SC
A Hybrid Enhanced Scatter Search—Composite I-Distance Indicator (eSS-CIDI) Optimization Approach for Determining Weights Within Composite Indicators;;;Hybrid Enhanced Public opinion Policy development methodologically;;;Considering the impact composite indicators can have on public opinion and policy development, the need for their frameworks to be methodologically sound and statistically verified is growing daily. One of the issues in the process of composite indicator construction which has generated much debate is how to choose the weighting scheme. To address this slippery step, we propose an optimization approach based on the enhanced Scatter Search (eSS) metaheuristic. In this paper, the eSS algorithm is applied to obtain a weighting scheme which will increase the stability of the composite indicator. The objective function is based on the relative contributions of indicators, while the problem constraints rely on the bootstrap Composite I-distance Indicator (CIDI) approach which is also proposed herein. The eSS-CIDI approach combines the exploration capability of eSS and the data-driven constraints devised from the bootstrap CIDI. This novel weighting approach was tested on two acknowledged composite indicators: the Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) and the Networked Readiness Index (NRI). Results indicate that the composite indicators created using the eSS-CIDI weighting approach are more stable than the official ones.;;;SC
Multi-level text document similarity estimation and its application for plagiarism detection;;;Text documents Corpus Deep learning Machine method;;;Nowadays, rapid access to the text data on the internet, and simplicity in modifying them, made plagiarism a serious problem. Similarity detection is an approach to identifying plagiarism between text documents. In this paper, we present a three-step method based on the vector representation of words for similarity detection of Persian text documents. Words represent vectors in N-dimensional space and similarity between the source and suspicious documents describe as cosine distance between these vectors. Results on the PAN2016 corpus, show that the proposed method with 00:01:27(h:m:s) run-time for each pair of documents, has a plagdet of 94.37%. It outperforms the support vector machine method and deep learning method by 4.33% and 3.6% respectively. The result of the proposed method on PAN2015 has 00:01:21(h:m:s) run-time and plagdet of 96.94%, which outperforms 9.94% compared to the graph-based method in plagiarism detection of Persian text documents.;;;C
Similarity versus relatedness: A novel approach in extractive Persian document summarisation;;;Clustering coherency extractive summarisation Persian document summarisation relatedness semantic relations similarity;;;Automatic text summarisation is the process of creating a summary from one or more documents by eliminating the details and preserving the worthwhile information. This article presents a single/multi-document summariser using a novel clustering method for creating summaries. First, a feature selection phase is employed. Then, FarsNet, the Persian WordNet, is utilised to extract the semantic information of words. Therefore, the input sentences are categorised into three main clusters: similarity, relatedness and coherency. Each similarity cluster contains similar sentences to its core, while each relatedness cluster contains sentences that are related (but not similar) to its core. The coherency clusters show the sentences that should be kept together to preserve the coherency of the summary. Finally, the centroid of each similarity cluster having the most feature score is added to an empty summary. The summary is enlarged by including related sentences from relatedness clusters and excluding similar sentences to its content iteratively. Coherency clusters are applied to the created summary in the last step. The proposed method has been compared with three known existing text summarisation systems and techniques for the Persian language: FarsiSum, Parsumist and Ijaz. Our proposed method leads to improvement in experimental results on different measurements including precision, recall, F-measure, ROUGE-N and ROUGE-L.;;;C
A similarity-based method for retrieving documents from the SCI/SSCI database;;;Information retrieval similarity neural network;;;As more and more documents become electronically available, finding documents in large databases that fit users' needs is becoming increasingly important. In the past, the document search problem was dealt with using the database query approach or the text-based search approach. In this paper, we investigate this problem, focusing on the SCI/SSCI databases from ISI. Specifically, we design our search methodology based on the four fields commonly seen in a scientific research document: abstract, title, keywords, and reference list. Of these four, only the abstract field can be viewed as a normal text, while the other three have their own characteristics to differentiate them from texts. Therefore, we first develop a method to compute the similarity value for each field. Our next problem is combining the four similarity values into a final value. One approach is to assign weights to each and compute the weighted sum. We have not adopted this simple weighting method, however, because it is difficult to determine appropriate weights. Instead, we use the back propagation neural network to combine them. Finally, extensive experiments have been carried out using real documents drawn from TKDE journal, and the results indicate that in all situations our method has a much higher accuracy than the traditional text-based search approach.;;;C
Plagiarism Meets Paraphrasing: Insights for the Next Generation in Automatic Plagiarism Detection;;;Linguistic phenomena Plagiarism cases detection Frameworks ;;;Although paraphrasing is the linguistic mechanism underlying many plagiarism cases, little attention has been paid to its analysis in the framework of automatic plagiarism detection. Therefore, state-of-the-art plagiarism detectors find it difficult to detect cases of paraphrase plagiarism. In this article, we analyze the relationship between paraphrasing and plagiarism, paying special attention to which paraphrase phenomena underlie acts of plagiarism and which of them are detected by plagiarism detection systems. With this aim in mind, we created the P4P corpus, a new resource that uses a paraphrase typology to annotate a subset of the PAN-PC-10 corpus for automatic plagiarism detection. The results of the Second International Competition on Plagiarism Detection were analyzed in the light of this annotation.;;;C
Paraphrase type identification for plagiarism detection using contexts and word embeddings;;;Plagiarism Digital information Paraphrasin mechanisms Insertion Deletion;;;Paraphrase types have been proposed by researchers as the paraphrasing mechanisms underlying acts of plagiarism. Synonymous substitution, word reordering and insertion/deletion have been identified as some of the common paraphrasing strategies used by plagiarists. However, similarity reports generated by most plagiarism detection systems provide a similarity score and produce matching sections of text with their possible sources. In this research we propose methods to identify two important paraphrase types – synonymous substitution and word reordering in paraphrased, plagiarised sentence pairs. We propose a three staged approach that uses context matching and pretrained word embeddings for identifying synonymous substitution and word reordering. Our proposed approach indicates that the use of Smith Waterman Algorithm for Plagiarism Detection and ConceptNet Numberbatch pretrained word embeddings produces the best performance in terms of F1F1 scores. This research can be used to complement similarity reports generated by currently available plagiarism detection systems by incorporating methods to identify paraphrase types for plagiarism detection.;;;C
A Survey of Text Alignment Visualization;;;Task analysis Data visualization Visualization Heuristic algorithms Tools Bioinformatics Dynamic programming;;;Text alignment is one of the fundamental techniques text-related domains like natural language processing, computational linguistics, and digital humanities. It compares two or more texts with each other aiming to find similar textual patterns, or to estimate in general how different or similar the texts are. Visualizing alignment results is an essential task, because it helps researchers getting a comprehensive overview of individual findings and the overall pattern structure. Different approaches have been developed to visualize and help making sense of these patterns depending on text size, alignment methods, and, most importantly, the underlying research tasks demanding for alignment. On the basis of those tasks, we reviewed existing text alignment visualization approaches, and discuss their advantages and drawbacks. We finally derive design implications and shed light on related future challenges.;;;C
A survey of word embeddings based on deep learning;;;Neural networks-based models Embeddings based Deep learning;;;The representational basis for downstream natural language processing tasks is word embeddings, which capture lexical semantics in numerical form to handle the abstract semantic concept of words. Recently, the word embeddings approaches, represented by deep learning, has attracted extensive attention and widely used in many tasks, such as text classification, knowledge mining, question-answering, smart Internet of Things systems and so on. These neural networks-based models are based on the distributed hypothesis while the semantic association between words can be efficiently calculated in low-dimensional space. However, the expressed semantics of most models are constrained by the context distribution of each word in the corpus while the logic and common knowledge are not better utilized. Therefore, how to use the massive multi-source data to better represent natural language and world knowledge still need to be explored. In this paper, we introduce the recent advances of neural networks-based word embeddings with their technical features, summarizing the key challenges and existing solutions, and further give a future outlook on the research and application.;;;C
Study on text representation method based on deep learning and topic information;;;Topic-based CBOW Baseline models Deep learning Topic information;;;Deep learning provides a new modeling method for natural language processing. In recent years, it has been applied in language model, text classification, machine translation, sentiment analysis, question and answer system, word distributed representation, etc., and a series of theoretical research results have been obtained. For the text representation task, this paper studies the strategy of fusing global and local context information, and proposes a word representation model called Topic-based CBOW that integrates deep neural network, topic information and word order information. Then, based on the word distributed representation obtained by Topic-based CBOW, a short text representation method with TF–IWF-weighted pooling is proposed. Finally, the performance of the Topic-based CBOW model and the short text representation are compared with the baseline models, and it is found that the proposed method improves the quality of the word distributed representation to some extent by introducing the topic vector and retaining word order information, and text representation also performs well in text classification tasks.;;;C
Word n-gram attention models for sentence similarity and inference;;;Attention models Deep learning Natural language understanding Natural Language Inference Semantic textual similarity;;;Semantic Textual Similarity and Natural Language Inference are two popular natural language understanding tasks used to benchmark sentence representation models where two sentences are paired. In such tasks sentences are represented as bag of words, sequences, trees or convolutions, but the attention model is based on word pairs. In this article we introduce the use of word n-grams in the attention model. Our results on five datasets show an error reduction of up to 41% with respect to the word-based attention model. The improvements are especially relevant with low data regimes and, in the case of natural language inference, on the recently released hard subset of Natural Language Inference datasets.;;;C
The N-Grams Based Text Similarity Detection Approach Using Self-Organizing Maps and Similarity Measures;;;Self-organizing maps Text mining Text similarity measures N-grams Frequency matrix;;;In the paper the word-level n-grams based approach is proposed to find similarity between texts. The approach is a combination of two separate and independent techniques: self-organizing map (SOM) and text similarity measures. SOM’s uniqueness is that the obtained results of data clustering, as well as dimensionality reduction, are presented in a visual form. The four measures have been evaluated: cosine, dice, extended Jaccard’s, and overlap. First of all, texts have to be converted to numerical expression. For that purpose, the text has been split into the word-level n-grams and after that, the bag of n-grams has been created. The n-grams’ frequencies are calculated and the frequency matrix of dataset is formed. Various filters are used to create a bag of n-grams: stemming algorithms, number and punctuation removers, stop words, etc. All experimental investigation has been made using a corpus of plagiarized short answers dataset.;;;C
Framework for syntactic string similarity measures;;;Similarity measure String similarity Information retrieval Text processing;;;Similarity measure is an essential component of information retrieval, document clustering, text summarization, and question answering, among others. In this paper, we introduce a general framework of syntactic similarity measures for matching short text. We thoroughly analyze the measures by dividing them into three components: character-level similarity, string segmentation, and matching technique. Soft variants of the measures are also introduced. With the help of two existing toolkits (SecondString and SimMetric), we provide an open-source Java toolkit of the proposed framework, which integrates the individual components together so that completely new combinations can be created. Experimental results reveal that the performance of the similarity measures depends on the type of the dataset. For well-maintained dataset, using a token-level measure is important but the basic (crisp) variant is usually enough. For uncontrolled dataset where typing errors are expected, the soft variants of the token-level measures are necessary. Among all tested measures, a soft token-level measure that combines set matching and q-grams at the character level perform best. A gap between human perception and syntactic measures still remains due to lacking semantic analysis.;;;C
Methods for identifying versioned and plagiarized documents;;;Plagiarized documents Greatly ismpliefies Fingerprinting technique;;;documents and mirroring of documents in multiple locations, and greatly simplifies the task of plagiarizing the work of others. We evaluate two families of methods for searching a collection to find documents that are coderivative, that is, are versions or plagiarisms of each other. The first, the ranking family, uses information retrieval techniques; extending this family, we propose the identity measure, which is specifically designed for identification of coderivative documents. The second, the fingerprinting family, uses hashing to generate a compact document description, which can then be compared to the fingerprints of the documents in the collection. We introduce a new method for evaluating the effectiveness of these techniques, and demonstrate it in practice. Using experiments on two collections, we demonstrate that the identity measure and the best fingerprinting technique are both able to accurately identify coderivative documents. However, for fingerprinting parameters must be carefully chosen, and even so the identity measure is clearly superior.;;;C
Automatic plagiarism detection in obfuscated text;;;Plagiarism education research publishing  support vector machine classifier;;;Plagiarism is a serious problem in education, research, publishing and other fields. Automatic plagiarism detection systems are crucial for ensuring the integrity and genuineness of intellectual work. There are different types of plagiarism, such as copy–paste, obfuscation and translation. In particular, obfuscated text is one of the hardest types of plagiarism to detect. In this paper, we propose an automatic plagiarism detection system for obfuscated text based on a support vector machine classifier that exploits a set of lexical, syntactic and semantic features. We evaluated the performance of the proposed system on benchmark English and Arabic corpora made available by the PAN Workshop series: PAN 2012, PAN 2013, PAN 2014 and PAN@FIRE2015. We also compared the performance of our system to the performances of other systems that participated in the PAN competitions. The obtained results show that our system had the best performance in terms of the F-measure on the PAN 2012 and on the PAN@FIRE2015 obfuscated sub-corpora, was among the top four on the PAN 2013 corpus and was among the top two on the PAN 2014 corpus.;;;C
A hybrid approach for measuring semantic similarity based on IC-weighted path distance in WordNet;;;Semantic similarity WordNet Natural lenguage processing;;;As a valuable tool for text understanding, semantic similarity measurement enables discriminative semantic-based applications in the fields of natural language processing, information retrieval, computational linguistics and artificial intelligence. Most of the existing studies have used structured taxonomies such as WordNet to explore the lexical semantic relationship, however, the improvement of computation accuracy is still a challenge for them. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a hybrid WordNet-based approach CSSM-ICSP to measuring concept semantic similarity, which leverage the information content(IC) of concepts to weight the shortest path distance between concepts. To improve the performance of IC computation, we also develop a novel model of the intrinsic IC of concepts, where a variety of semantic properties involved in the structure of WordNet are taken into consideration. In addition, we summarize and classify the technical characteristics of previous WordNet-based approaches, as well as evaluate our approach against these approaches on various benchmarks. The experimental results of the proposed approaches are more correlated with human judgment of similarity in term of the correlation coefficient, which indicates that our IC model and similarity detection approach are comparable or even better for semantic similarity measurement as compared to others.;;;C
Using word semantic concepts for plagiarism detection in text documents;;;Plagiarism detection Semantic concepts Experiments Conducted ;;;Plagiarism is a common problem in the modern age. With the advance of Internet, it is more and more convenient to access other people’s writings or publications. When someone uses the content of a text in an undesirable way, plagiarism may occur. Plagiarism infringes the intellectual property rights, so it is a serious problem nowadays. However, detecting plagiarism effectively is a challenging work. Traditional methods, like vector space model or bag-of-words, are short of providing a good solution due to the incapability of handling the semantics of words satisfactorily. In this paper, we propose a new method for plagiarism detection. We use Word2vec to transform the words into word vectors which are able to reveal the semantic relationship among different words. Through word vectors, words are clustered into concepts. Then documents and their paragraphs are represented in terms of concepts, and plagiarism detection can be done more effectively. A number of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the good performance of our proposed method.;;;C
Paragraph-based representation of texts: A complex networks approach;;;Network science Complex networks Language networks Document classification Text networks;;;An interesting model to represent texts as a graph (also called network) is the word adjacency (co-occurrence) representation, which is known to capture mainly syntactical features of texts. In this study, we propose a novel network model, which is based on the similarity between the content of the paragraphs of the text. By considering this representation, we characterized the networks with respect to measurements developed in the network science area. We characterized these measurements according to their properties regarding their ability to discriminate between real and shuffled texts, and to capture information regarding the content similarity of chunks of text. In order to compare the results with a more sophisticated approach, we employed a methodology based on word2vec. When comparing real and shuffled texts, the results revealed that real texts tend to have a more well-defined community structure. This characteristic can be related to the organization of subjects in real texts. The network-based measurements that were found to be able to discriminate real from shuffled texts were used as features in a classifier. As a result, the obtained accuracy was 98.72%. In order to compare with a different methodology, we used doc2vec-based features in the classifier, yielding an accuracy rate of 70.8%. The proposed network-based features were employed to analyze the Voynich manuscript, which was found to be compatible with real texts according to the considered characteristics.;;;C
Motion control of virtual reality based on an inertia-based sensing mechanism and a novel approach to redirected walking;;;Motion control Virtual reality sistem Inertia-based sensing mechanism;;;This research presents a motion control algorithm for constructing a portable virtual reality system, which can operate in any indoor or outdoor open space without the need for support from any pre-installed infrastructure. The real head and foot motions continuously measured by inertial sensors during natural walking are used as a part of the inputs to the algorithm to control the virtual walking motions of the user. In conjunction with such control, a novel approach to redirected walking is incorporated in the algorithm to continuously adjust the rotation of the virtual environment to redirect the user away from the boundary (i.e., walls and objects) of the real environment. Such an approach, namely the relative approach, adopts the directions and distances of the boundary relative to the user (i.e., the relative local information) instead of the absolute positions and orientations of the user for performing redirection. A ranging sensor is used for collecting the relative local information. The effectiveness of the algorithm was experimentally verified and demonstrated.;;;C
Multi-User Redirected Walking and Resetting Using Artificial Potential Fields;;;Legged locomotion Navigation Space vehicles Tracking Force Orbits;;;Head-mounted displays (HMDs) and large area position tracking systems can enable users to navigate virtual worlds through natural walking. Redirected walking (RDW) imperceptibly steers immersed users away from physical world obstacles allowing them to explore unbounded virtual worlds while walking in limited physical space. In cases of imminent collisions, resetting techniques can reorient them into open space. This work introduces categorically new RDW and resetting algorithms based on the use of artificial potential fields that “push” users away from obstacles and other users. Data from human subject experiments indicate that these methods reduce potential single-user resets by 66% and increase the average distance between resets by 86% compared to previous techniques. A live multi-user study demonstrates the viability of the algorithm with up to 3 concurrent users, and simulation results indicate that the algorithm scales efficiently up to at least 8 users and is effective with larger groups.;;;C
Performance of Redirected Walking Algorithms in a Constrained Virtual World;;;Rendering (computer graphics) Tracking Algorithm comparison Virtual environments;;;Redirected walking algorithms imperceptibly rotate a virtual scene about users of immersive virtual environment systems in order to guide them away from tracking area boundaries. Ideally, these distortions permit users to explore large unbounded virtual worlds while walking naturally within a physically limited space. Many potential virtual worlds are composed of corridors, passageways, or aisles. Assuming users are not expected to walk through walls or other objects within the virtual world, these constrained worlds limit the directions of travel and as well as the number of opportunities to change direction. The resulting differences in user movement characteristics within the physical world have an impact on redirected walking algorithm performance. This work presents a comparison of generalized RDW algorithm performance within a constrained virtual world. In contrast to previous studies involving unconstrained virtual worlds, experimental results indicate that the steer-to-orbit keeps users in a smaller area than the steer-to-center algorithm. Moreover, in comparison to steer-to-center, steer-to-orbit is shown to reduce potential wall contacts by over 29%.;;;C
The Torus Treadmill: realizing locomotion in VEs;;;Belts Virtual prototyping Ultrasonic variables measurement Rubber Actuators Bars Prototypes Motion detection;;;Locomotion in virtual environments (VEs) remains one of the major problems in current virtual reality research. The most intuitive way to move about the real world is to travel on foot. People often feel a better sense of distance or direction while walking than while riding in a vehicle. This article discusses the development of a locomotion device that provides a sense of walking. In terms of natural interaction, the physical exertion of walking proves essential to locomotion. The research of my colleagues and I aims to give users a sense of walking while their position remains localized in the physical world. We've developed several prototypes of interface devices for walking. From the results of our research, we concluded that an infinite surface would offer an ideal means for giving people a sense of walking. Our device, called the Torus Treadmill, uses a torus-shaped surface to realize the locomotion interface. The surface employs 12 sets of treadmills connected side-by-side and driven in a perpendicular direction. These treadmills generate an infinite surface. We measured the motion of the users' feet with magnetic sensors. The floor moves in the opposite direction of the walker, canceling the motion of each step. The walker's position remains localized in the real world by this computer-controlled motion of the floor. The walker can freely change direction. An image of the virtual space appears in a head-mounted display corresponding to the walker's virtual position.;;;C
15 Years of Research on Redirected Walking in Immersive Virtual Environments;;;Computer architecture Object recognition Virtual environments Space exploration Virtual reality Augmented reality;;;Virtual reality users wearing head-mounted displays can experience the illusion of walking in any direction for infinite distance while, in reality, they are walking a curvilinear path in physical space. This is accomplished by introducing unnoticeable rotations to the virtual environment-a technique called redirected walking. This paper gives an overview of the research that has been performed since redirected walking was first practically demonstrated 15 years ago.;;;C
Evaluation of Reorientation Techniques and Distractors for Walking in Large Virtual Environments;;;Virtual environment Humans Laboratories Turning Bicycles Loudspeakers Tracking;;;Virtual environments (VEs) that use a real-walking locomotion interface have typically been restricted in size to the area of the tracked lab space. Techniques proposed to lift this size constraint, enabling real walking in VEs that are larger than the tracked lab space, all require reorientation techniques (ROTs) in the worst-case situation-when a user is close to walking out of the tracked space. We propose a new ROT using visual and audial distractors-objects in the VE that the user focuses on while the VE rotates-and compare our method to current ROTs through three user studies. ROTs using distractors were preferred and ranked more natural by users. Our findings also suggest that improving visual realism and adding sound increased a user's feeling of presence. Users were also less aware of the rotating VE when ROTs with distractors were used.;;;C
The Design and Evaluation of a Large-Scale Real-Walking Locomotion Interface;;;Prediction algorithms Legged locomotion Navigation Vectors Virtual environments Target tracking;;;Redirected Free Exploration with Distractors (RFEDs) is a large-scale real-walking locomotion interface developed to enable people to walk freely in Virtual Environments (VEs) that are larger than the tracked space in their facility. This paper describes the RFED system in detail and reports on a user study that evaluated RFED by comparing it to Walking-in-Place (WIP) and Joystick (JS) interfaces. The RFED system is composed of two major components, redirection and distractors. This paper discusses design challenges, implementation details, and lessons learned during the development of two working RFED systems. The evaluation study examined the effect of the locomotion interface on users' cognitive performance on navigation and wayfinding measures. The results suggest that participants using RFED were significantly better at navigating and wayfinding through virtual mazes than participants using walking-in-place and joystick interfaces. Participants traveled shorter distances, made fewer wrong turns, pointed to hidden targets more accurately and more quickly, and were able to place and label targets on maps more accurately, and more accurately estimate the virtual environment size.;;;C
Estimation of Detection Thresholds for Redirected Walking Techniques;;;Cameras, Navigation Large-scale systems Displays Tracking Psychology Humans Testing;;;In immersive virtual environments (IVEs), users can control their virtual viewpoint by moving their tracked head and walking through the real world. Usually, movements in the real world are mapped one-to-one to virtual camera motions. With redirection techniques, the virtual camera is manipulated by applying gains to user motion so that the virtual world moves differently than the real world. Thus, users can walk through large-scale IVEs while physically remaining in a reasonably small workspace. In psychophysical experiments with a two-alternative forced-choice task, we have quantified how much humans can unknowingly be redirected on physical paths that are different from the visually perceived paths. We tested 12 subjects in three different experiments: (E1) discrimination between virtual and physical rotations, (E2) discrimination between virtual and physical straightforward movements, and (E3) discrimination of path curvature. In experiment E1, subjects performed rotations with different gains, and then had to choose whether the visually perceived rotation was smaller or greater than the physical rotation. In experiment E2, subjects chose whether the physical walk was shorter or longer than the visually perceived scaled travel distance. In experiment E3, subjects estimate the path curvature when walking a curved path in the real world while the visual display shows a straight path in the virtual world. Our results show that users can be turned physically about 49 percent more or 20 percent less than the perceived virtual rotation, distances can be downscaled by 14 percent and upscaled by 26 percent, and users can be redirected on a circular arc with a radius greater than 22 m while they believe that they are walking straight.;;;C
The HIVE: A huge immersive virtual environment for research in spatial cognition;;;Human spatial cognition Virtual environment Move realistically;;;Research in human spatial cognition has benefited from the advent of virtual environment (VE) technology; however, few VE systems currently enable users to move realistically over large physical spaces. Here, we describe a huge immersive virtual environment (HIVE) that offers untethered tracking of users in a 570 m2 physical space. This large tracking area allows users to move through virtual worlds in the same manner in which they move in the real world and enables behavioral research in spatial cognition examining mental processes that require extensive movement through an environment. We provide a detailed description of this system, and report an experiment examining distance estimation in virtual environments that illustrates the utility of the HIVE.;;;C
A Simplified Quaternion-Based Algorithm for Orientation Estimation From Earth Gravity and Magnetic Field Measurements;;;Earth Gravity Magnetic field measurement Quaternions Magnetic sensors Accelerometers Magnetometers Coordinate measuring machines Computational efficiency Azimuth;;;Orientation of a static or slow-moving rigid body can be determined from the measured gravity and local magnetic field vectors. Some formulation of the QUaternion ESTimator (QUEST) algorithm is commonly used to solve this problem. Triads of accelerometers and magnetometers are used to measure gravity and local magnetic field vectors in sensor coordinates. In the QUEST algorithm, local magnetic field measurements affect not only the estimation of yaw but also that of roll and pitch. Due to the deviations in the direction of the magnetic field vector between locations, it is not desirable to use magnetic data in calculations that are related to the determination of roll and pitch. This paper presents a geometrically intuitive 3-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) orientation estimation algorithm with physical meaning [which is called the factored quaternion algorithm (FQA)], which restricts the use of magnetic data to the determination of the rotation about the vertical axis. The algorithm produces a quaternion output to represent the orientation. Through a derivation based on half-angle formulas and due to the use of quaternions, the computational cost of evaluating trigonometric functions is avoided. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has an overall accuracy that is essentially identical to that of the QUEST algorithm and is computationally more efficient. Additionally, magnetic variations cause only azimuth errors in FQA attitude estimation. A singularity avoidance method is introduced, which allows the algorithm to track through all orientations.;;;C
Estimation of Human Foot Motion During Normal Walking Using Inertial and Magnetic Sensor Measurements;;;Foot Quaternions Acceleration Accelerometers Legged locomotion Estimation Vectors;;;A foot motion filtering algorithm is presented for estimating foot kinematics relative to an earth-fixed reference frame during normal walking motion. Algorithm input data are obtained from a foot-mounted inertial/magnetic measurement unit. The sensor unit contains a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis angular rate sensor, and a three-axis magnetometer. The algorithm outputs are the foot kinematic parameters, which include foot orientation, position, velocity, acceleration, and gait phase. The foot motion filtering algorithm incorporates novel methods for orientation estimation, gait detection, and position estimation. Accurate foot orientation estimates are obtained during both static and dynamic motion using an adaptive-gain complementary filter. Reliable gait detection is accomplished using a simple finite state machine that transitions between states based on angular rate measurements. Accurate position estimates are obtained by integrating acceleration data, which has been corrected for drift using zero velocity updates. Algorithm performance is examined using both simulations and real-world experiments. The simulations include a simple but effective model of the human gait cycle. The simulation and experimental results indicate that a position estimation error of less than 1% of the total distance traveled is achievable using commonly available commercial sensor modules.;;;C
Improved Redirection with Distractors: A Large-Scale-Real-Walking Locomotion Interface and its Effect on Navigation in Virtual Environments;;; Methodology and Techniques Interaction techniques Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism Virtual Reality Multimedia Information Systems-Artificial;;;Users in virtual environments often find navigation more difficult than in the real world. Our new locomotion interface, Improved Redirection with Distractors (IRD), enables users to walk in larger-than-tracked space VEs without predefined waypoints. We compared IRD to the current best interface, really walking, by conducting a user study measuring navigational ability. Our results show that IRD users can really walk through VEs that are larger than the tracked space and can point to targets and complete maps of VEs no worse than when really walking.;;;C
Evaluation of Reorientation Techniques for Walking in Large Virtual Environments;;;Reorientation Techniques Virtual environments Locomotion interface Systems-Artificial;;;Virtual environments (VEs) that use a real-walking locomotion interface have typically been restricted in size to the area of the tracked lab space. Techniques proposed to lift this size constraint, enabling real walking in VEs that are larger than the tracked lab space, all require reorientation techniques (ROTs) in the worst-case situation-when a user is close to walking out of the tracked space. We propose a new ROT using distractors-objects in the VE for the user to focus on while the VE rotates and compare our method to current ROTs through two user studies. Our findings show ROTs using distractors were preferred and ranked more natural by users. Users were also less aware of the rotating VE, when ROTs with distractors were used.;;;C
Effects of Tracking Area Shape and Size on Artificial Potential Field Redirected Walking;;;Redirected walking virtual environments navigation simulation;;;Immersive Virtual Environment systems that utilize Head Mounted Displays and a large tracking area have the advantage of being able to use natural walking as a locomotion interface. In such systems, difficulties arise when the virtual world is larger than the tracking area and users approach area boundaries. Redirected walking (RDW) is a technique that distorts the correspondence between physical and virtual world motion to steer users away from boundaries and obstacles, including other co-immersed users. Recently, a RDW algorithm was proposed based on the use of artificial potential fields (APF), in which walls and obstacles repel the user. APF-RDW effectively supports multiple simultaneous users and, unlike other RDW algorithms, can easily account for tracking area dimensions and room shape when generating steering instructions. This work investigates the performance of a refined APF-RDW algorithm in different sized tracking areas and in irregularly shaped rooms, as compared to a Steer-to-Center (STC) algorithm and an un-steered control condition. Data was generated in simulation using logged paths of prior live users, and is presented for both single-user and multi-user scenarios. Results show the ability of APF-RDW to steer effectively in irregular concave shaped tracking areas such as Lshaped rooms or crosses, along with scalable multi-user support, and better performance than STC algorithms in almost all conditions.;;;C
Redirected walking, virtual environments, navigation, simulation;;;Virtual environments navigation simulation Locomotion interface;;;This paper describes the Sarcos Treadport locomotion interface, a large tilting treadmill whose unique aspect is the application of forces to a user’s torso. The application of torso forces is necessary to provide missing inertial forces during acceleration on a treadmill and to stop a user from walking through virtual walls. Torso forces can also substitute for treadmill tilt, as has been validated by psychological, biomechanical and energetic studies. A harness has been designed to transmit forces to the torso with minimum backlash while maintaining comfort. The experience of locomotion is integrated into a virtual environment comprised of a CAVElike visual display and head-tracked stereo sound synthesis. To complete the multi-sensory experience, atmospheric and olfactory displays are under development.;;;C
Preliminary Environment Mapping for Redirected Walking;;;Human-centered computing Virtual reality Computing methodologies Tracking;;;Redirected walking applications allow a user to explore large virtual environments in a smaller physical space by employing so-called redirection techniques. To further improve the immersion of a virtual experience, path planner algorithms were developed which choose redirection techniques based on the current position and orientation of the user. In order to ensure a reliable performance, planning algorithms depend on accurate position tracking using an external tracking system. However, the disadvantage of such a tracking method is the time-consuming preparation of the physical environment which renders the system immobile. A possible solution to eliminate this dependency is to replace the external tracking system with a state-of-the-art inside-out tracker based on the concept of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).;;;C
Multimodal sentiment analysis with asymmetric window multi-attentions;;;Multimodal sentiment analysis Neural network Compared methods;;;Multimodal sentiment analysis is an actively developing field of research. The main research problem in this domain is to model both intra-modality and inter-modality dynamics. However, most of the current work cannot do well with these two aspects of dynamics. In this study, we introduce a novel model to achieve this. The novelty of our model is to represent the asymmetric weights of contexts at a particular timestamp using asymmetric windows. Further, multiple separate attentions are performed on the contexts, producing an updated representation of the particular timestamp. Each representation corresponding to one of the modes multiplies a weight vector controlled by a neural network. All multiplied results are merged with an addition operation. Experiments on the MOSI dataset show our model outperforms the compared methods.;;;C
A multimodal feature learning approach for sentiment analysis of social network multimedia;;;Multimodal feature learning Unsupervised learning Neural networks;;;In this paper we investigate the use of a multimodal feature learning approach, using neural network based models such as Skip-gram and Denoising Autoencoders, to address sentiment analysis of micro-blogging content, such as Twitter short messages, that are composed by a short text and, possibly, an image. The approach used in this work is motivated by the recent advances in: i) training language models based on neural networks that have proved to be extremely efficient when dealing with web-scale text corpora, and have shown very good performances when dealing with syntactic and semantic word similarities; ii) unsupervised learning, with neural networks, of robust visual features, that are recoverable from partial observations that may be due to occlusions or noisy and heavily modified images. We propose a novel architecture that incorporates these neural networks, testing it on several standard Twitter datasets, and showing that the approach is efficient and obtains good classification results.;;;C
Multimodal Machine Learning: A Survey and Taxonomy;;;Speech recognition Visualization Media Speech Multimedia communication Streaming media Hidden Markov models;;;Our experience of the world is multimodal - we see objects, hear sounds, feel texture, smell odors, and taste flavors. Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together. Multimodal machine learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. It is a vibrant multi-disciplinary field of increasing importance and with extraordinary potential. Instead of focusing on specific multimodal applications, this paper surveys the recent advances in multimodal machine learning itself and presents them in a common taxonomy. We go beyond the typical early and late fusion categorization and identify broader challenges that are faced by multimodal machine learning, namely: representation, translation, alignment, fusion, and co-learning. This new taxonomy will enable researchers to better understand the state of the field and identify directions for future research.;;;C
Challenges of Sentiment Analysis for Dynamic Events;;;Sentiment analysis Twitter Social network services Tagging Artificial intelligence;;;Efforts to assess people's sentiments on Twitter have suggested that Twitter could be a valuable resource for studying political sentiment and that it reflects the offline political landscape. Many opinion mining systems and tools provide users with people's attitudes toward products, people, or topics and their attributes/aspects. However, although it may appear simple, using sentiment analysis to predict election results is difficult, since it is empirically challenging to train a successful model to conduct sentiment analysis on tweet streams for a dynamic event such as an election. This article highlights some of the challenges related to sentiment analysis encountered during monitoring of the presidential election using Kno.e.sis's Twitris system.;;;C
Bi-modal emotion recognition from expressive face and body gestures;;;Bi-modal emotion recognition Facial expression Expressive body gestures Feature-level fusion Decision-level fusion;;;Psychological research findings suggest that humans rely on the combined visual channels of face and body more than any other channel when they make judgments about human communicative behavior. However, most of the existing systems attempting to analyze the human nonverbal behavior are mono-modal and focus only on the face. Research that aims to integrate gestures as an expression mean has only recently emerged. Accordingly, this paper presents an approach to automatic visual recognition of expressive face and upper-body gestures from video sequences suitable for use in a vision-based affective multi-modal framework. Face and body movements are captured simultaneously using two separate cameras. For each video sequence single expressive frames both from face and body are selected manually for analysis and recognition of emotions. Firstly, individual classifiers are trained from individual modalities. Secondly, we fuse facial expression and affective body gesture information at the feature and at the decision level. In the experiments performed, the emotion classification using the two modalities achieved a better recognition accuracy outperforming classification using the individual facial or bodily modality alone.;;;C
Towards an intelligent framework for multimodal affective data analysis;;;Multimodal sentiment analysis Facial expressions Speech Text Emotion analysis Affective computing;;;An increasingly large amount of multimodal content is posted on social media websites such as YouTube and Facebook everyday. In order to cope with the growth of such so much multimodal data, there is an urgent need to develop an intelligent multi-modal analysis framework that can effectively extract information from multiple modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal information extraction agent, which infers and aggregates the semantic and affective information associated with user-generated multimodal data in contexts such as e-learning, e-health, automatic video content tagging and human–computer interaction. In particular, the developed intelligent agent adopts an ensemble feature extraction approach by exploiting the joint use of tri-modal (text, audio and video) features to enhance the multimodal information extraction process. In preliminary experiments using the eNTERFACE dataset, our proposed multi-modal system is shown to achieve an accuracy of 87.95%, outperforming the best state-of-the-art system by more than 10%, or in relative terms, a 56% reduction in error rate.;;;C
Automatic prediction of frustration;;;Affective Learning Companion Intelligent Tutoring System Learner state assessment Affect recognition;;;Predicting when a person might be frustrated can provide an intelligent system with important information about when to initiate interaction. For example, an automated Learning Companion or Intelligent Tutoring System might use this information to intervene, providing support to the learner who is likely to otherwise quit, while leaving engaged learners free to discover things without interruption. This paper presents the first automated method that assesses, using multiple channels of affect-related information, whether a learner is about to click on a button saying “I’m frustrated.” The new method was tested on data gathered from 24 participants using an automated Learning Companion. Their indication of frustration was automatically predicted from the collected data with 79% accuracy (chance=58%). The new assessment method is based on Gaussian process classification and Bayesian inference. Its performance suggests that non-verbal channels carrying affective cues can help provide important information to a system for formulating a more intelligent response.;;;C
Multimodal sentiment analysis using hierarchical fusion with context modeling;;;Multimodal fusion mechanism Sentiment analysis Context modeling;;;Multimodal sentiment analysis is a very actively growing field of research. A promising area of opportunity in this field is to improve the multimodal fusion mechanism. We present a novel feature fusion strategy that proceeds in a hierarchical fashion, first fusing the modalities two in two and only then fusing all three modalities. On multimodal sentiment analysis of individual utterances, our strategy outperforms conventional concatenation of features by 1%, which amounts to 5% reduction in error rate. On utterance-level multimodal sentiment analysis of multi-utterance video clips, for which current state-of-the-art techniques incorporate contextual information from other utterances of the same clip, our hierarchical fusion gives up to 2.4% (almost 10% error rate reduction) over currently used concatenation. The implementation of our method is publicly available in the form of open-source code.;;;C
A multimodal alignment framework for spoken documents;;;Multimodal alignment framework Multimedia document browsing;;;We present a multimodal document alignment framework, which highlights existing alignment relationships between documents that are discussed and recorded during multimedia events such as meetings. These relationships that should help indexing the archives of these events are detected using various techniques from natural language processing and information retrieval. The main alignment strategies studied are based on thematic, quotation and reference relationships. At the analysis level, the alignment framework was applied at several levels of granularity of documents, requiring specific document segmentation techniques. Our framework that is language independent was evaluated on corpora in French and English, including meetings and scientific presentations. The satisfactory evaluation results obtained at several stages show the importance of our approach in bridging the gap between meeting documents, independently from the language and domain. They highlight also the utility of the multimodal alignment in advanced applications, e.g. multimedia document browsing, content-based / temporal-based searching, etc.;;;C
Deep learning-based late fusion of multimodal information for emotion classification of music video;;;Deep learning-based Multimodal information Affective computing;;;Affective computing is an emerging area of research that aims to enable intelligent systems to recognize, feel, infer and interpret human emotions. The widely spread online and off-line music videos are one of the rich sources of human emotion analysis because it integrates the composer’s internal feeling through song lyrics, musical instruments performance and visual expression. In general, the metadata which music video customers to choose a product includes high-level semantics like emotion so that automatic emotion analysis might be necessary. In this research area, however, the lack of a labeled dataset is a major problem. Therefore, we first construct a balanced music video emotion dataset including diversity of territory, language, culture and musical instruments. We test this dataset over four unimodal and four multimodal convolutional neural networks (CNN) of music and video. First, we separately fine-tuned each pre-trained unimodal CNN and test the performance on unseen data. In addition, we train a 1-dimensional CNN-based music emotion classifier with raw waveform input. The comparative analysis of each unimodal classifier over various optimizers is made to find the best model that can be integrate into a multimodal structure. The best unimodal modality is integrated with corresponding music and video network features for multimodal classifier. The multimodal structure integrates whole music video features and makes final classification with the SoftMax classifier by a late feature fusion strategy. All possible multimodal structures are also combined into one predictive model to get the overall prediction. All the proposed multimodal structure uses cross-validation to overcome the data scarcity problem (overfitting) at the decision level. The evaluation results using various metrics show a boost in the performance of the multimodal architectures compared to each unimodal emotion classifier. The predictive model by integration of all multimodal structure achieves 88.56% in accuracy, 0.88 in f1-score, and 0.987 in area under the curve (AUC) score. The result suggests human high-level emotions are automatically well classified in the proposed CNN-based multimodal networks, even though a small amount of labeled data samples is available for training.;;;C
A review of affective computing: From unimodal analysis to multimodal fusion;;;Affective computing Sentiment analysis Multimodal affect analysis Multimodal fusion Audio visual Text information fusion;;;Affective computing is an emerging interdisciplinary research field bringing together researchers and practitioners from various fields, ranging from artificial intelligence, natural language processing, to cognitive and social sciences. With the proliferation of videos posted online (e.g., on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter) for product reviews, movie reviews, political views, and more, affective computing research has increasingly evolved from conventional unimodal analysis to more complex forms of multimodal analysis. This is the primary motivation behind our first of its kind, comprehensive literature review of the diverse field of affective computing. Furthermore, existing literature surveys lack a detailed discussion of state of the art in multimodal affect analysis frameworks, which this review aims to address. Multimodality is defined by the presence of more than one modality or channel, e.g., visual, audio, text, gestures, and eye gage. In this paper, we focus mainly on the use of audio, visual and text information for multimodal affect analysis, since around 90% of the relevant literature appears to cover these three modalities. Following an overview of different techniques for unimodal affect analysis, we outline existing methods for fusing information from different modalities. As part of this review, we carry out an extensive study of different categories of state-of-the-art fusion techniques, followed by a critical analysis of potential performance improvements with multimodal analysis compared to unimodal analysis. A comprehensive overview of these two complementary fields aims to form the building blocks for readers, to better understand this challenging and exciting research field.;;;C
Fusing audio, visual and textual clues for sentiment analysis from multimodal content;;;Multimodal fusion Big social data analysis Opinion mining Multimodal sentiment analysis Sentic computing;;;A huge number of videos are posted every day on social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. This makes the Internet an unlimited source of information. In the coming decades, coping with such information and mining useful knowledge from it will be an increasingly difficult task. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for multimodal sentiment analysis, which consists in harvesting sentiments from Web videos by demonstrating a model that uses audio, visual and textual modalities as sources of information. We used both feature- and decision-level fusion methods to merge affective information extracted from multiple modalities. A thorough comparison with existing works in this area is carried out throughout the paper, which demonstrates the novelty of our approach. Preliminary comparative experiments with the YouTube dataset show that the proposed multimodal system achieves an accuracy of nearly 80%, outperforming all state-of-the-art systems by more than 20%.;;;C
Brain-computer interaction research at the computer vision and multimedia laboratory, University of Geneva;;;Brain computer interfaces Computer vision Laboratories Electroencephalography Application software Iterative methods Noise robustness Stochastic resonance Brain modeling Statistics;;;This paper describes the work being conducted in the domain of brain-computer interaction (BCI) at the Multimodal Interaction Group, Computer Vision and Multimedia Laboratory, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. The application focus of this work is on multimodal interaction rather than on rehabilitation, that is how to augment classical interaction by means of physiological measurements. Three main research topics are addressed. The first one concerns the more general problem of brain source activity recognition from EEGs. In contrast with classical deterministic approaches, we studied iterative robust stochastic based reconstruction procedures modeling source and noise statistics, to overcome known limitations of current techniques. We also developed procedures for optimal electroencephalogram (EEG) sensor system design in terms of placement and number of electrodes. The second topic is the study of BCI protocols and performance from an information-theoretic point of view. Various information rate measurements have been compared for assessing BCI abilities. The third research topic concerns the use of EEG and other physiological signals for assessing a user's emotional status.;;;C
Multimodal subspace support vector data description;;;Feature transformation Multimodal data One-class classification Support vector data description Subspace learning;;;In this paper, we propose a novel method for projecting data from multiple modalities to a new subspace optimized for one-class classification. The proposed method iteratively transforms the data from the original feature space of each modality to a new common feature space along with finding a joint compact description of data coming from all the modalities. For data in each modality, we define a separate transformation to map the data from the corresponding feature space to the new optimized subspace by exploiting the available information from the class of interest only. We also propose different regularization strategies for the proposed method and provide both linear and non-linear formulations. The proposed Multimodal Subspace Support Vector Data Description outperforms all the competing methods using data from a single modality or fusing data from all modalities in four out of five datasets.;;;C
Natural language based financial forecasting: a survey;;;Natural language processing Computational linguistics Pragmatic research perspective;;;Natural language processing (NLP), or the pragmatic research perspective of computational linguistics, has become increasingly powerful due to data availability and various techniques developed in the past decade. This increasing capability makes it possible to capture sentiments more accurately and semantics in a more nuanced way. Naturally, many applications are starting to seek improvements by adopting cutting-edge NLP techniques. Financial forecasting is no exception. As a result, articles that leverage NLP techniques to predict financial markets are fast accumulating, gradually establishing the research field of natural language based financial forecasting (NLFF), or from the application perspective, stock market prediction. This review article clarifies the scope of NLFF research by ordering and structuring techniques and applications from related work. The survey also aims to increase the understanding of progress and hotspots in NLFF, and bring about discussions across many different disciplines.;;;C
Multimodal Sentiment Intensity Analysis in Videos: Facial Gestures and Verbal Messages;;;Feature extraction Videos Sentiment analysis Visualization Motion pictures YouTube Information exchange;;;People share their opinions, stories, and reviews through online video sharing websites every day. The automatic analysis of these online opinion videos is bringing new or understudied research challenges to the field of computational linguistics and multimodal analysis. Among these challenges is the fundamental question of exploiting the dynamics between visual gestures and verbal messages to be able to better model sentiment. This article addresses this question in four ways: introducing the first multimodal dataset with opinion-level sentiment intensity annotations; studying the prototypical interaction patterns between facial gestures and spoken words when inferring sentiment intensity; proposing a new computational representation, called multimodal dictionary, based on a language-gesture study; and evaluating the authors' proposed approach in a speaker-independent paradigm for sentiment intensity prediction. The authors' study identifies four interaction types between facial gestures and verbal content: neutral, emphasizer, positive, and negative interactions. Experiments show statistically significant improvement when using multimodal dictionary representation over the conventional early fusion representation (that is, feature concatenation).;;;C
Multicentric infantile myofibromatosis with extensive involvement limited to bone;;;Infantile myofibromatosis Tumors Nodules Osteolytic Diagnostic;;;Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is the most common benign fibrous tumor of infancy, characterized by the development of single or multiple nodules in the skin, soft tissues, bone, and/or viscera. Multicentric forms are less frequent and can affect different tissues simultaneously and their prognosis depends on their extension and visceral involvement. Rarely, these forms are limited to the skeleton, in which case the absence of extraosseous lesions makes it difficult to suspect this entity. We present the case of an infant with multiple radiolucent lesions involving the skull, ribs, spine, and long bones, discovered in a radiological study performed after a minor trauma. A broad differential diagnosis was considered based on the osteolytic and polyostotic nature of the lesions on imaging studies. This report details and illustrates the typical radiological findings in bony involvement of IM, which suggest this disorder over other diagnostic options.;;;M
Pediatric Fibroblastic and Myofibroblastic Tumors: A Pictorial Review;;;Myofibroblastic tumors Neoplasms Radiologic assessment Intramuscular lesions ;;;Pediatric fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors are a relatively common group of soft-tissue proliferations that are associated with a wide spectrum of clinical behavior. These tumors have been divided into the following categories on the basis of their biologic behavior: benign (eg, myositis ossificans, myofibroma, fibromatosis colli), intermediate–locally aggressive (eg, lipofibromatosis, desmoid fibroma), intermediate–rarely metastasizing (eg, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, infantile fibrosarcoma, low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma), and malignant (eg, fibromyxoid sarcoma, adult fibrosarcoma). Imaging has a key role in the evaluation of lesion origin, extent, and involvement with adjacent structures, and in the treatment management and postresection surveillance of these tumors. The imaging findings of these tumors are often nonspecific. However, certain imaging features, such as low or intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and extension along fascial planes, support the diagnosis of a fibroblastic or myofibroblastic tumor. In addition, certain tumors have characteristic imaging findings (eg, multiple subcutaneous or intramuscular lesions in infantile myofibromatosis, plaquelike growth pattern of Gardner fibroma, presence of adipose tissue in lipofibromatosis) or characteristic clinical manifestations (eg, great toe malformations in fibrodysplasia ossificans fibroma, neonatal torticollis in fibromatosis colli) that suggest the correct diagnosis. Knowledge of the syndrome associations of some of these tumors—for example, the association between familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome and both Gardner fibroma and desmoid fibromatosis, and that between nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and cardiac fibroma—further facilitate a diagnosis. The recognition of key imaging findings can help guide treatment management and help avoid unnecessary intervention in cases of benign lesions such as myositis ossificans and fibromatosis colli. In this article, we describe the various types of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic tumors in children and the characteristic clinical manifestations, imaging features, and growth patterns of these neoplasms—all of which aid in the appropriate radiologic assessment and management of these lesions.;;;M
Infantile myofibromatosis: A series of 28 cases;;;good prognosis infantile myofibromatosis long-term follow-up pediatrics systemic complications tumoral lesions;;;IM was more frequent in boys (60.8%). Skin lesions were congenital in 64.3% of cases. The solitary form accounted for 50% of cases. Most nodules were painless, arising in cutaneous or subcutaneous tissue. The multicentric form accounted for 39% of cases; the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or muscle was involved in 97.8% of cases, and the bones in 50% of cases. The generalized form had a mortality rate of 33% (one-third of cases). Multicentric and generalized forms regressed spontaneously; severe local complications were observed, and late recurrent nodules developed in a few cases.;;;M
Soft Tissue Tumors in First Year of Life: A Report of 190 Cases;;;soft tissue neoplasms hemangioendothelioma congenital tumors fibromatosis rhabdomyosarcoma;;;A comprehensive review of soft tissue tumors in children and adolescents disclosed the presence of 190 neoplasms in 183 patients, which were diagnosed in infants between birth and 12 months of age; these infants represented approximately 20% of our entire pediatric soft tissue tumor series. In excess of 75% of cases were pathologically benign with the hemangioendothelioma, lymphangioma, and fibromatosis-myofibromatosis constituting the majority of cases in this category. Fibrous histiocytoma and lipoblastoma were the other two benign entities. Congenital-infantile fibrosarcoma was considered a borderline tumor because of its infrequently manifested potential for metastasis; none of the 13 cases in the present study behaved in a malignant fashion. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor were the two principal types (17 of 27 cases) of malignant soft tissue tumors. In contrast to soft tissue tumors in the first two decades, those in the first year of life were more often benign despite their cellularity and presence of mitotic activity. Fibroblastic-myofibroblastic tumors were more frequent in this young age group, whereas neurogenic and myogenic tumors were relatively more common in children older than 1 year of age. The trunk and head and neck region were the preferred topographic sites rather than the extremities, which was the case in children beyond the first year of life.;;;M
Risk-adapted therapy for infantile myofibromatosis in children;;;Infantile myofibromatosis Tumors arising skin Subcutaneous tissue;;;Infantile myofibromatosis is characterized by proliferation of benign fibrous tumors arising in skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, or bone. Solitary and multicentric forms are described. Few reports are available in the pediatric population. To improve the knowledge of this rare tumor in infants, the authors present a series of all cases of infantile myofibromatosis treated in their institution over a 9-year period in order to propose treatment guidelines based on their experience and a review of the literature.;;;M
A Rare Case of Infantile Myofibromatosis Presenting to the Emergency Department as Undiagnosed Long Bone Fractures;;;Mesenchymal tumors Infantile Myofibromatosis Emergency department;;;Infantile myofibromatosis is a disorder of mesenchymal tumors that usually presents within the first 2 years of life. Most patients initially present because of the presence of visible or palpable subcutaneous tumors. We report a case of a fussy 5-week-old infant who presented to an emergency department with bilateral femur fractures initially thought to be due to nonaccidental trauma or a metabolic bone disorder. She was ultimately diagnosed after admission with infantile myofibromatosis after taking an extensive family history and after further laboratory and radiologic evaluation. There are no previously published cases of undiagnosed infantile myofibromatosis presenting to the emergency department, especially with multiple long bone fractures.;;;M
Multiple Bone Lesions in an 8-Month-Old Child Presenting with Pathologic Fracture.;;;Multiple Bone Lesions Appendicular skeleton Pathologic fracture;;;An otherwise healthy 8-month-old boy presented with a pathologic fracture of the distal aspect of the radius. Further work-up demonstrated widespread osseous lesions of the axial and the appendicular skeleton with no soft-tissue or visceral involvement. Infantile myofibromatosis has a spectrum of severity that demands a careful and complete work-up. In rare cases such as the present one, it can manifest as multiple osseous lesions. The patient in the present case was managed conservatively, with no morbidity demonstrated at 1 year of follow-up.;;;M
Multicentric infantile myofibromatosis: a rare disorder of the calvarium;;;Mesenchymal disorder Multicentric infantile myofibromatosis;;;Infantile myofibromatosis is a rare mesenchymal disorder that occurs predominantly in infancy and early childhood, in either solitary or multicentric form. It can affect soft tissue, muscle, skeleton, and occasionally, visceral organs. Infantile myofibromatosis without visceral involvement frequently undergoes spontaneous regression. Multicentric infantile myofibromatosis with involvement exclusively of the calvarium is extremely rare.;;;M
Myofibromatosis: imaging characteristics;;;Infantile myofibromatosis Peripheral enhancement Gadolinium administration;;;Infantile myofibromatosis is the most common fibrous tumor of infancy. It can involve the skin, muscle, bone, and viscera. This uncommon entity is subdivided into solitary and multicentric forms, with or without visceral involvement. Objective: To describe the imaging characteristics of extracranial myofibromatosis. Materials and methods: Six infants, aged 1 day–1 week, were evaluated by imaging. All six patients had evaluation of one of the masses by US; four patients had CT evaluation of at least one of the masses; and five patients had evaluation by MRI. Results: The US appearance of the myofibromas included a mass with a purely anechoic center with a thick wall, a mass with a partially anechoic center, and a mass without anechoic components. On enhanced CT, the masses had lower or similar attenuation compared to adjacent muscle, with some masses exhibiting peripheral enhancement. The MR appearance consisted of low signal on T1-weighted imaging. On T2-weighted imaging, two had low signal of the center and the other three had high signal. All masses showed peripheral enhancement after gadolinium administration. Conclusions: Myofibromas have variable appearance on US, with a mass with an anechoic center being the most common feature. On CT, the mass can exhibit peripheral enhancement, calcifications, and erosion of adjacent bone. The MR appearance consisted of low signal on T1-weighted imaging and high or low signal of the center on T2-weighted imaging. All masses showed peripheral enhancement after gadolinium administration.;;;M
Infantile myofibromatosis: The most common fibrous tumor of infancy;;;Infantile myofibromatosis congenital generalized fibromatosis;;;We describe the clinical courses of four infants with infantile myofibromatosis (IM). This entity is a mesenchymal disorder of early infancy characterized by the formation of tumors in skin, muscle, viscera, bone, and subcutaneous tissues. Previously known as congenital generalized fibromatosis, IM was formerly thought to be a rare condition that was frequently fatal. The majority of the 170 affected patients we describe have been diagnosed since 1980. Furthermore, the mortality rate for these patients is <15%. Our review includes the clinical manifestations, as well as histopathologic features, and discusses the prognosis in affected infants. We found that infants with solitary lesions or multiple lesions without visceral involvement generally have a benign course. However, in patients with the multicentric form of the disorder and visceral involvement, 73% have died. Because the lesions may not be easily discernible and most spontaneously resolve, the condition is underdiagnosed and underreported. IM is the most common fibrous tumor of infancy and must be considered when evaluating children who present with either solitary or multiple tumors, particularly during the neonatal period.;;;M
Mutations in PDGFRB Cause Autosomal-Dominant Infantile Myofibromatosis;;;Infantile myofibromatosis Mesenchymal proliferation Autosomal-Dominant;;;Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is a disorder of mesenchymal proliferation characterized by the development of nonmetastasizing tumors in the skin, muscle, bone, and viscera. Occurrence within families across multiple generations is suggestive of an autosomal-dominant (AD) inheritance pattern, but autosomal-recessive (AR) modes of inheritance have also been proposed. We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) in members of nine unrelated families clinically diagnosed with AD IM to identify the genetic origin of the disorder. In eight of the families, we identified one of two disease-causing mutations, c.1978C>A (p.Pro660Thr) and c.1681C>T (p.Arg561Cys), in PDGFRB. Intriguingly, one family did not have either of these PDGFRB mutations but all affected individuals had a c.4556T>C (p.Leu1519Pro) mutation in NOTCH3. Our studies suggest that mutations in PDGFRB are a cause of IM and highlight NOTCH3 as a candidate gene. Further studies of the crosstalk between PDGFRB and NOTCH pathways may offer new opportunities to identify mutations in other genes that result in IM and is a necessary first step toward understanding the mechanisms of both tumor growth and regression and its targeted treatment.;;;M
Recurrent SRF-RELA Fusions Define a Novel Subset of Cellular Myofibroma/Myopericytoma;;;Cellular myofibroblastic tumor Cellular Myofibroma Myopericytomas;;;Cellular myofibroblastic tumors other than desmoid-type fibromatosis are often diagnostically challenging due to their relative rarity, lack of known genetic abnormalities, and expression of muscle markers which may be confused with sarcomas with myogenic differentiation. In this study we investigate the molecular alterations of a group of cellular myofibroblastic lesions with in the myofibroma and myopericytoma spectrum for better subclassification. Two index cases were studied by paired-end RNA sequencing for potential fusion gene discovery. One chest wall soft tissue tumor in a 3-month-old girl case showed a SRF-C3orf62 fusion, while the other, a forearm lesion in an 8-year-old girl, showed a SRF-RELA fusion. Further screening of 42 cellular examples of myofibroma/myopericytoma by fluorescence in situ hybridization identified additional 8 cases with recurrent SRF gene rearrangements, 6 of them showing identical SRF-RELA fusions. The cohort was composed of 7 females and 3 males, with a wide age range of 3 months to 63 years (mean=17). All tumors showed a densely packed growth of oval to spindle cells with fibrillary eosinophilic cytoplasm, arranged either in intersecting fascicles or with a distinct nested pattern around a rich vascular network. Despite the dense cellularity and variable mitotic activity none of the lesions displayed nuclear pleomorphism or necrosis. All tumors showed coexpression for SMA and desmin, in most cases with a strong and diffuse pattern of staining, while myogenin was consistently negative. No distant metastases were seen in the few cases with follow-up information. A control group of 34 well-characterized myofibroblastic and perivascular tumors, including 10 typical myofibromas and 3 myopericytomas, were also investigated for SRF gene abnormalities by fluorescence in situ hybridization and were negative. In summary, we report a subset of cellular variants of myofibroma and myopericytoma showing a smooth muscle-like immunophenotype and harboring recurrent SRF-RELA gene fusions, which mimic sarcomas with myogenic differentiation.;;;M
Diagnostic limitations and considerations in the imaging evaluation of advanced multicentric infantile myofibromatosis;;;Infantile myofibromatosis Pulmonary hypertension Bowel obstruction Soft tissue tumors;;;Infantile myofibromatosis, the most common fibrous tumor of infancy, is classified in 2 forms; as a solitary nodule or as numerous, widely-distributed multicentric lesions with or without visceral involvement. Although benign, multicentric myofibromas are still associated with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality due to the infiltration of critical structures. Herein, we present a case of an infant with aggressive PDGFRB and NOTCH3 mutation-negative myofibromas distributed throughout the vascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. The extensive disease resulted in pulmonary hypertension, respiratory failure and gastrointestinal obstruction refractory to chemotherapy and unamenable to surgical resection. Despite the presence of numerous highly invasive myofibromas, multiple imaging modalities largely underestimated, or even missed, tumors found at autopsy. This case demonstrates the limitations of radiographic imaging to assess disease burden in multicentric infantile myofibromatosis. The postmortem findings of extensive disease far exceeding what was demonstrated by multiple imaging modalities suggests that pediatricians should have a high index of suspicion for undetected tumors if clinical deterioration is otherwise unexplained.;;;M
A RARE CASE OF NEONATAL-ONSET INFANTILE MYOFIBROMATOSIS WITH METASTATIC RECURRENCE IN ADULTHOOD;;;infantile myofibromatosis recurrence visceral involvement metastasis;;;Infantile myofibromatosis (IM) is a rare mesenchymal disorder, typically observed during infancy and characterized by the development of myofibroblastic tumors within skin, muscle, bone or viscera. In most cases, spontaneous regression of the lesions occurs before the age of four, however therapeutic tools such as surgery and chemotherapy sometimes need to be implemented. Metastatic recurrence of this condition is very rare. We report the case of a newborn infant with multicentric IM involving the skin, intestinal tract and bone, who required long-term symptomatic treatment. Spontaneous regression was noticed at the age of four but twenty years later she presented with a complete spontaneous right pneumothorax revealing cystic pulmonary metastases of IM. There have been very few reports of metastatic recurrence of IM in adulthood and this unique presentation underlines the need for long-term follow-up of these patients to detect and prevent possible complications.;;;M
More than Just Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis: A Radiologic Review of Histiocytic Disorders;;;Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Magnetic resonance imaging Ultrasonography;;;Although Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a familiar entity to most radiologists and to pediatric radiologists in particular, it is but one of a group of disorders caused by the overproduction of histiocytes, a subtype of white blood cells. Other less familiar diseases in this category are Erdheim-Chester disease (ECD), juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD), and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). This review describes the classification system, clinical manifestations, and pathophysiology of each disease, with particular attention to differential radiographic findings, including typical locations of involvement and varying appearances at radiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and nuclear medicine imaging. Although LCH has a wide variety of manifestations and appearances, classic imaging findings include vertebra plana, skull lesions with a beveled edge, the “floating tooth” sign, bizarre lung cysts, and an absent posterior pituitary bright spot with infundibular thickening. The classic imaging findings of ECD are a perirenal rind of soft tissue and patchy long bone osteosclerosis. RDD has more nonspecific imaging findings, including lymphadenopathy (most commonly cervical) and intracranial lesions. Imaging findings in HLH are broad, with the most common abnormalities being hepatosplenomegaly, cerebral volume loss, and periventricular white matter abnormalities. JXG can manifest at imaging, but radiology does not play a major role in diagnosis. Familiarity with these disorders and their associated imaging findings facilitates correct and timely diagnosis. Imaging also features prominently in the assessment of treatment response.;;;M
Metastatic Dissemination of a Neuroblastoma;;;bone metastasis neuroblastoma computed tomography abdominal tumor periorbital ecchymosis;;;A 4-year-old boy presented with a history of proptosis, periorbital ecchymosis (“raccoon eyes”), weight loss, headache, and vomiting for 2 months. On clinical examination, he presented with periorbital ecchymosis, subconjunctival hemorrhage (Figure 1), proptosis, and stiff neck. No other abnormality was found. The findings of a lumbar puncture were normal. Laboratory tests showed anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain showed a lobulated periorbital mass involving the roof and lateral wall of the left orbit, and “hair-on-end” spiculated periostitis of the orbits, sphenoid wings, and skull associated with bone destruction and irregular sutural diastasis (Figure 2; available at www.jpeds.com). These findings were suggestive of neuroblastoma metastasis. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen revealed a well-defined heterogeneous mass in the right suprarenal region, 9 × 7.7 cm in size, with areas of calcification and enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes (Figure 3). Chest CT was normal. Biopsy of the retroperitoneal mass demonstrated neuroblastoma. The final diagnosis was neuroblastoma with diffuse bone marrow infiltration.;;;M
Medial patellofemoral ligament MRI abnormalities in the setting of MCL injuries: are they clinically relevant?;;;Medial patellofemoral superficial medial collateral ligament;;;One hundred patients with MCL injury were identified. These included 37 grade I sprains, 33 partial tears, 20 high-grade partial tears, and 10 full thickness tears. Abnormal edema was present at the femoral attachment of the tMPFL in 83%. The odMPFL was abnormal in 90%, most commonly involving the femoral third. No patients had imaging evidence of concurrent lateral patellar dislocation on the initial MRI study. No patients had documented patellofemoral instability at the time of original injury or upon follow-up. No patients required MPFL reconstruction.;;;M
Anatomical Reconstruction of the Medial Collateral Ligament and Posteromedial Corner of the Knee in Patients With Chronic Medial Collateral Ligament Instability;;;Severe medial collateral ligament Anatomical Reconstruction;;;From July 2002 to December 2005, 61 patients with grade 3 or 4 medial instability were treated with MCL reconstruction. Median age was 33 years (range, 14–62). Thirteen underwent isolated MCL reconstructions, 34 had combined MCL and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, and 14 had multiple ligament reconstructions. All patients had reconstruction of the medial collateral and the posteromedial complex using ipsilateral semitendinosus autografts. Fifty patients were available for follow-up more than 24 months postoperatively and were examined by an independent observer using objective International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) measures and subjective Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS).;;;M
Injuries to the Medial Collateral Ligament and Associated Medial Structures of the Knee;;;Medial Collateral Ligament Anatomic repair Cruciate ligament tear;;;The superficial medial collateral ligament and other medial knee stabilizers—i.e., the deep medial collateral ligament and the posterior oblique ligament—are the most commonly injured ligamentous structures of the knee. The main structures of the medial aspect of the knee are the proximal and distal divisions of the superficial medial collateral ligament, the meniscofemoral and meniscotibial divisions of the deep medial collateral ligament, and the posterior oblique ligament.;;;M
Imaging of Athletic Injuries of Knee Ligaments and Menisci: Sports Imaging Series;;;Illustrate patterns Knee Ligaments Highlight traumatic osseous;;;Acute knee injuries are a common source of morbidity in athletes and if overlooked may result in chronic functional impairment. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the knee has become the most commonly performed musculoskeletal MR examination and is an indispensable tool in the appropriate management of the injured athlete. Meniscal and ligamentous tearing are the most frequent indications for surgical intervention in sports injuries and an understanding of the anatomy, biomechanics, mechanisms of injury, and patterns of injury are all critical to accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. These will be discussed in reference to meniscal tears and injuries of the cruciate ligaments as well as injuries of the posterolateral and posteromedial corners of the knee.;;;M
The supporting structures and layers on the medial side of the knee: an anatomical analysis.;;;Supporting structures Anatomical analysis Consistently placed;;;The goal of this study was to delineate the consistent anatomical structures in the medial side of the knee and to determine their relationship to one another. One hundred and fifty-four fresh human knee joints were dissected. A three-layered pattern was found in which ligaments could be consistently placed. We have made suggestions regarding the nomenclature of these structures. The limits of of the so-called capsule and its significance as a stabilizer of the knee joint were examined. Only minor variations in the over-all anatomical pattern were found.;;;M
High resolution magnetic resonance imaging of the patellar retinaculum: normal anatomy, common injury patterns, and pathologies;;;Medial patellar retinaculum High resolution magnetic Pathologies ;;;The medial patellar retinaculum (MPR) and the lateral patellar retinaculum (LPR) are vital structures for the stability of the patella. Failure to identify or treat injury to the patellar retinaculum is associated with recurrent patellar instability and contributes to significant morbidity. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) readily depicts the detailed anatomy of various components (layers) of the retinacula. In this review article, we discuss normal anatomy, important landmarks, common injury patterns, and other pathologies encountered in patellar retinacula. High field strength MRI is an excellent noninvasive tool for evaluation of patellar retinaculum anatomy and pathology. This article will help the reader become familiar with normal imaging findings and the most commonly occurring injuries/pathologies in MPR and LPR.;;;M
Anatomy and biomechanics of the medial patellofemoral ligament;;;Patellofemoral ligament retinacular tissue connecting epicondyle ;;;The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) is a band of retinacular tissue connecting the femoral medial epicondyle to the medial edge of the patella. The MPFL is approximately 55 mm long, and its width has been reported to range from 3 to 30 mm. The MPFL is overlaid by the distal part of vastus medialis obliquus to a variable extent, and fibres of MPFL merge into the deep aspect of the muscle. Despite the MPFL being very thin, it had a mean tensile strength of 208 N, and has been reported to be the primary passive restraint to patellar lateral displacement. Lateral patellar displacement tests in vitro showed that the patella subluxed most easily at 20° knee flexion. The contribution of the MPFL to resisting patellar lateral subluxation was greatest in the extended knee. This finding was linked to the retinaculae being tightest in full knee extension, and slackening with flexion.;;;M
The medial patellofemoral ligament: a dissection study;;;Medial patellofemoral ligament mechanoreceptors vastus medialis muscle;;;This study examined the anatomy including the innervation of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) and its relation to neighboring structures to help interpretation of magnetic resonance images and to improve the surgical approach to MPFL repair. The medial aspect of 39 unpreserved human knees were dissected and the MPFL and its relations to neighboring anatomical structures were measured exactly. The morphology and the attachments are described. The MPFL was present in all knees although varying in quality between individuals but not from side to side. The width of the MPFL was 1.9 cm (1.0–3.0) and length 5.3 cm (4.5–6.4). The superior edge of the MPFL medial to the vastus medialis muscle was always easily identified. Failure to identify the superior edge during MPFL surgery is therefore highly suggestive of a MPFL tear. The variation in the ratios of patella height to MPFL length and of patella width to MPFL length ratios was to high too be used to calculate the MPFL length in MPFL reconstruction surgery. The medial patellomeniscal ligament had a wide insertion at the anterior horn of the medial meniscus and a narrow insertion (0.3–0.5 cm) at the inferomedial corner of the patella in layer 3. Histological examination was made of 14 ligaments documenting the presence of free nerve endings but no mechanoreceptors.;;;M
The Anatomy of the Medial Patellofemoral Ligament;;; Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Careful dissection reconstruct it anatomically;;;Present in all specimens, the medial patellofemoral ligament was found to have 2 origins: (1) a transverse 10.6-mm origin from the bony groove between the medial epicondyle and the adductor tubercle, and (2) an oblique decussation originating from the proximal 30 mm of the leading edge of the superficial medial collateral ligament. The 2 origins combined and inseparably joined the vastus medialis obliquus tendon and inserted securely into the ventral edge of the bony patella over a span of 28.2 ± 5.6 mm adjacent to the articular surface of the patella. The length from the femoral origin to the patella was 59.8 ± 4.8 mm. The key to the dissection was finding the fine capsular vessels from the descending genicular artery that is between layers I and II of the medial retinacular structures.;;;M
The Anatomy of the Medial Part of the Knee;;;Medial Part electromagnetic superficial medial collateral ligament;;;While the anatomy of the medial part of the knee has been described qualitatively, quantitative descriptions of the attachment sites of the main medial knee structures have not been reported. The purpose of the present study was to verify the qualitative anatomy of medial knee structures and to perform a quantitative evaluation of their anatomic attachment sites as well as their relationships to pertinent osseous landmarks.;;;M
Medial collateral ligament injuries: evaluation of multiple signs, prevalence and location of associated bone bruises, and assessment with MR imaging.;;;Medial collateral ligament injuries magnetic resonance interobserver variability;;;To investigate the multiple signs of medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprains, including the location and prevalence of associated bone bruises, and evaluate the accuracy of the criteria proposed for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in grading these sprains. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MR images were evaluated for signs of MCL injury in 76 patients with MCL sprains and 25 asymptomatic volunteers. These signs were then correlated with standards used to determine MCL injury at clinical evaluation. The grade of MCL injury as determined with MR imaging criteria was compared with clinical findings. RESULTS: All signs demonstrated little interobserver variability and were specific. The most sensitive signs were fascial edema and loss of demarcation from adjacent fat. This MR imaging grading system was inaccurate for classification of grade 3 MCL tears and was only questionably accurate for grades 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: Multiple signs of MCL sprains on MR images have varying sensitivities. MR grading systems may not be accurate for classification of MCL injuries.;;;M
Co-existent medial collateral ligament injury seen following transient patellar dislocation: observations at magnetic resonance imaging;;;Co-existent medial collateral ligament transient lateral patellar dislocation magnetic resonance imaging ;;;This study reports on a series of patients who were diagnosed as having had a transient lateral patellar dislocation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The images were reviewed with specific reference to the medial collateral ligament (MCL), a heretofore undescribed concomitant injury. Eighty patients were diagnosed on MRI as having had transient lateral patellar dislocation. Their mean age was 23.9 years (SD 7.5). Forty patients (50.0%) had co-existent MCL injuries. These injuries were classified as grade 1 (n = 20), grade 2 (n = 17) and grade 3 (n = 3). These results suggest that MCL injury commonly accompanies transient lateral patella dislocation, most likely due to a shared valgus injury. It appears to occur more commonly in male patients and if unidentified may explain both delayed recovery and persistent morbidity in more severe cases. In this setting, without specifically excluding co-existent MCL injury, the current vogue for early rehabilitation should be adopted with caution.;;;M
Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Tears in the Setting of Multiligament Knee Injuries Rarely Cause Patellar Instability;;;Multiligament knee injuries Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Tears Patellar Instability;;;The records of all patients who underwent surgical reconstruction of MLKI (defined as a grade 3 injury of ≥2 ligaments) at a single institution from 2007 to 2010 were reviewed. Age, sex, knee dislocation classification (according to Schenck), and MRI findings were documented. All preoperative MRI scans were reviewed by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist to determine the presence or absence of MPFL involvement. If an MPFL tear was present, its anatomic location and severity as well as the presence of patellar or lateral femoral condyle bone bruises were documented. Inclusion criteria included (1) MLKI treated at a single institution, (2) presence of MPFL tear on preoperative MRI, and (3) minimum 2-year clinical follow-up. Patellar instability symptoms were assessed with the Kujala Knee Questionnaire. Functional outcomes were measured using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score. IKDC scores were compared between patients who sustained MLKIs with and without MPFL tears. There were 21 patients in each group.;;;M
MRI but not arthroscopy accurately diagnoses femoral MPFL injury in first-time patellar dislocations;;;Arthroscopic femoral disruption lateral patellar dislocation adductor tubercle;;;The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the femoral part of the medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) and its injury can be accurately assessed by standard knee arthroscopy in first-time patellar dislocations or whether preoperative MRI is required to determine injury location in patients where primary MPFL repair is attempted.;;;M
First-time Traumatic Patellar Dislocation;;;Traumatic Patellar Dislocation Acute patellar recurrent dislocations;;;Acute patellar dislocations can result in patellar instability, pain, recurrent dislocations, decreased level of sporting activity, and patellofemoral arthritis. The initial management of a first-time traumatic patellar dislocation is controversial with no evidence-based consensus to guide decision making. Most first-time traumatic patellar dislocations have been traditionally treated nonoperatively; however, there has been a recent trend in initial surgical management. We performed a systematic review of Level I-IV studies to make evidence-based medicine recommendations on how a clinician should approach the diagnosis and treatment of a first-time traumatic dislocation. More specifically we answer the primary question of when initial treatment should consist of operative versus closed management. Based on the review of 70 articles looking at study design, mean followup, subjective and validated outcome measures, redislocation rates, and long-term symptoms, we recommend initial nonoperative management of a first-time traumatic dislocation except in several specific circumstances. These include the presence of an osteochondral fracture, substantial disruption of the medial patellar stabilizers, a laterally subluxated patella with normal alignment of the contralateral knee, or a second dislocation, or in patients not improving with appropriate rehabilitation.;;;M
Three layers of the medial capsular and supporting structures of the knee: MR imaging-anatomic correlation;;;Medial capsular imaging-anatomic correlation ligaments;;;The authors used a three-layer approach to correlate the appearance of the capsule and ligaments of the medial side of the knee on magnetic resonance (MR) images with corresponding anatomic slices. MR images of six fresh cadaveric specimens were obtained by using a proton-density-weighted fast spin-echo sequence with a 256 x 512 matrix. Specimens were frozen and sliced with a band saw into 3. 0-mm-thick sections that corresponded to the MR images. Three layers were depicted on both anatomic slices and MR images. Layer 1 consisted of the deep crural fascia; layer 2, the superficial portion of the medial collateral ligament (MCL); and layer 3, the capsule, the deep portion of the MCL, the meniscofemoral and meniscotibial extensions of the deep portion of the MCL, and the patellomeniscal ligament. Along the anterior aspect of the medial side of the knee, layer 1 was fused with layer 2; along the posterior aspect of the knee, layer 2 was fused with layer 3.;;;M
Deep vein thrombosis in the thigh: MR imaging in two cases with atypical presentations;;;Deep vein thrombosis imaging of unsuspected clinical problem;;;Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common clinical problem affecting the lower extremities. Prompt imaging of suspected DVT is helpful for rapid diagnosis and proper treatment. However, patients without clear predisposing factors for DVT may be directed to alternative diagnoses of a musculoskeletal disorder. The few case reports and studies of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of unsuspected DVT are limited to the calf and knee. Here, we report two cases with a rare presentation of thigh MR imaging of unsuspected DVT. Identifying branching, abnormal intraluminal signals on fluid-sensitive imaging, or rim-enhancing tubular structures within the edema of the thigh muscle is important for differentiating intramuscular DVT from other thigh pathologies.;;;M
Advanced imaging in acute and chronic deep vein thrombosis;;;Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) acute DVT chronic DVT computed tomography venography (CTV) magnetic resonance venography (MR venography);;; Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) affecting the extremities is a common clinical problem. Prompt imaging aids in rapid diagnosis and adequate treatment. While ultrasound (US) remains the workhorse of detection of extremity venous thrombosis, CT and MRI are commonly used as the problem-solving tools either to visualize the thrombosis in central veins like superior or inferior vena cava (IVC) or to test for the presence of complications like pulmonary embolism (PE). The cross-sectional modalities also offer improved visualization of venous collaterals. The purpose of this article is to review the established modalities used for characterization and diagnosis of DVT, and further explore promising innovations and recent advances in this field.;;;M
Current DVT imaging;;;Current deep venous thrombosis imaging thrombectomy;;;Accurate diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is very difficult, and imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis or exclusion of DVT. The initial test of choice for diagnosis of acute thigh as well as upper extremity DVT is ultrasound, because of its high accuracy, relatively low cost, portability, and lack of ionizing radiation. In patients who are undergoing CT pulmonary angiography for suspected pulmonary embolism, CT venography can be performed as part of the examination, for comprehensive evaluation of the venous system in the legs, abdomen, and pelvis. MR has a problem-solving role, and conventional venography is now limited to specific scenarios including evaluation of central DVT in the upper extremities, as a prelude to intervention for thrombolysis/thrombectomy, and prior to placement of an inferior vena cava filter. This article discusses the imaging findings of DVT, and the role of these imaging examinations in the evaluation of patients with suspected DVT.;;;M
Unsuspected lower extremity deep venous thrombosis simulating musculoskeletal pathology;;;lower extremity deep venous thrombosis simulating musculoskeletal injuries;;;The purpose of this study was to highlight the critical role that MRI may play in diagnosing unsuspected lower extremity deep venous thrombosis and to stress the importance of scrutinizing MRI studies of the lower extremity showing apparently non-specific muscle edema for any evidence of intramuscular venous thrombosis.;;;M
Characterization of intramuscular calf vein thrombosis on routine knee MRI;;;intramuscular calf infrapopliteal deep vein thrombosis;;;Literature regarding intramuscular calf vein thrombosis (IMCVT) or infrapopliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is limited, particularly with regard to routine unenhanced knee examinations. We attempt to correlate routine unenhanced MRI findings with ultrasound evaluations of the lower extremity deep venous system.;;;M
Imaging of deep venous thrombosis: A multimodality overview;;;multimodality overview deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism;;;Accurate clinical diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is notoriously difficult, analogous to accurate clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Both are part of the same process of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Most cases of DVT are believed to begin in the calves, and approximately 90% of PE cases are believed to originate from the deep veins of the lower extremities and/or the pelvis. DVT usually begins around the leaflets of venous valves, especially in the calves, and can propagate superiorly. Less commonly, DVT can form in the abdominal,pelvic, or upper thigh veins, due to obstruction or other processes, and can then propagate inferiorly. DVT is related to stasis, hypercoagulability, and trauma to the venous wall; ie, Virchow’s triad. Risk factors include various blood disorders, malignancy, estrogen administration, dehydration, recent surgery or trauma, prolonged immobility, heart failure, mass effect on the deep veins, obesity, pregnancy, age > 40, and history of prior DVT.;;;M
Low prevalence of unexpected popliteal DVT detected on routine MRI assessment of the knee;;;Internal derangement of the knee DVT MRI Popliteal vein Incidental;;;The purpose of this study was to document the appearance and determine the prevalence of findings suspicious for popliteal vein thrombosis on magnetic resonance (MR) assessment of the knee joint.;;;M
Unicompartmental muscle edema: an early sign of deep venous thrombosis;;;Unicompartmental muscle edema traumatic injury subcutaneous edema;;;The finding of muscle edema restricted to a single muscle compartment on MRI usually indicates a diagnosis of traumatic injury, myositis, denervation or neoplasm. This case demonstrates that deep venous thrombosis can also be the cause of isolated deep posterior compartment muscle edema in the calf and should be considered in the differential diagnosis even in the absence of diffuse soft tissue or subcutaneous edema.;;;M
MR Imaging of Atraumatic Muscle Disorders;;;Atraumatic skeletal muscle magnetic resonance oxygenation mapping;;;Atraumatic disorders of skeletal muscles include congenital variants; inherited myopathies; acquired inflammatory, infectious, or ischemic disorders; neoplastic diseases; and conditions leading to muscle atrophy. These have overlapping appearances at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and are challenging for the radiologist to differentiate. The authors organize muscle disorders into four MR imaging patterns: (a) abnormal anatomy with normal signal intensity, (b) edema/inflammation, (c) mass, and (d) atrophy, highlighting each of their key clinical and imaging findings. Anatomic muscle variants, while common, do not produce signal intensity alterations and therefore are easily overlooked. Muscle edema is the most common pattern but is nonspecific, with a broad differential diagnosis. Autoimmune, paraneoplastic, and drug-induced myositis tend to be symmetric, whereas infection, radiation-induced injury, and myonecrosis are focal asymmetric processes. Architectural distortion in the setting of muscle edema suggests one of these latter processes. Intramuscular masses include primary neoplasms, metastases, and several benign masslike lesions that simulate malignancy. Some lesions, such as lipomas, low-flow vascular malformations, fibromatoses, and subacute hematomas, are distinctive, but many intramuscular masses ultimately require a biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Atrophy is the irreversible end result of any muscle disease of sufficient severity and is the dominant finding in disorders such as the muscular dystrophies, denervation myopathy, and sarcopenia.

Swollen lower extremity: role of MR imaging;;;magnetic resonance imaging differentiating lymphedema phlebedema lower limb;;;The authors assessed the use of magnetic resonance imaging in differentiating lymphedema, phlebedema, and lipedema of the lower limb. They examined 14 patients: five with lipedema, five with lymphedema, and four with phlebedema. T1- and T2-weighted transaxial sequences were performed before administration of gadolinium tetraazacyclododecane-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and T1-weighted spin-echo sequences were performed after administration of Gd-DOTA in each patient. Images of patients with lipedema showed homogeneously enlarged subcutaneous layers, with no increase in signal intensity at T2-weighted imaging or after Gd-DOTA administration. Patients with phlebedema had areas containing increased amounts of fluid within muscle and subcutaneous fat. In lymphedema, a honeycomb pattern above the fascia between muscle and subcutis was observed, with a marked increase in signal intensity at T2-weighted imaging. After Gd-DOTA administration, there was only a slight increase in signal intensity in the subcutis in lymphedema and phlebedema and a moderate increase in signal intensity in muscle in phlebedema.;;;M
Acute swelling of the limbs: magnetic resonance pictorial review of fascial and muscle signal changes;;;Acute deep venous thrombosis Acute denervation Dermatomyositis Magnetic resonance imaging Pyoderma gangrenosum Soft-tissue infections;;;This pictorial review analyzes the magnetic resonance (MR) fascial/muscular changes in 69 patients referred as emergencies with acute swelling of the limbs (ASL) from various causes. Methods and material: A prospective MR imaging (MRI) study of 69 patients referred as emergencies for ASL was performed. Our population consisted of 45 patients with skin and soft-tissue infections (cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis, and pyomyositis), six patients with soft-tissue inflammatory diseases (dermatomyositis, graft-versus-host disease), 11 patients with acute deep venous thrombosis, three patients with rhabdomyolysis, one patient with acute denervation and three other patients with rare diseases. Hematomas, tumorous or infectious bone involvement and soft-tissue tumors were excluded. All studies included spin echo T1-weighted images and spin echo T2-weighted images. Gadolinium-enhanced spin echo T1-weighted images were obtained when an abscess was suspected on T2-weighted images. Selective fat-saturated T1- and T2-weighted sequences were also used. MRI analysis was performed to obtain a compartmentalized anatomical approach according to the location of signal abnormalities in subcutaneous fat, superficial and deep fascia and muscle. Results: In all patients with ASL, MRI demonstrated soft-tissue abnormalities involving subcutaneous fat, superficial fascia, deep fascia, or muscle. Although MR findings were non-specific, MRI appears sensitive for detecting subtle fascial and muscle signal changes. Conclusions: In skin and soft-tissue infections, MRI can be helpful for therapeutic management by determining the depth of soft-tissue involvement, particularly within fasciae and muscles, which is partly related to the severity of cellulitis with severe systemic manifestations. MRI can also aid the surgeon in diagnosing abscesses. In inflammatory diseases, MRI can determine the best site for biopsy and also monitor therapeutic response.;;;M
Pitfalls in CT Venography of Lower Limbs and Abdominal Veins;;;Lower Limbs Abdominal Veins Vein-to-muscle attenuation gradient;;;Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism are described as two aspects of the same continuum—venopulmonary thromboembolic disease, which results in significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Recent studies [1,2,3,4,5,6] have found that a combination of helical CT angiography of pulmonary arteries and indirect CT venography of lower limbs allows a complete one-session evaluation of venopulmonary thromboembolism. Sensitivities of 89-100% and specificities of 94-100% have been reported and compared with sonography [3, 4, 6]. Nevertheless, detection of an acute clot with CT venography requires optimal selection of technical parameters, knowledge of venous anatomy and common variants, and knowledge of CT signs reflecting DVT. The radiologist should also be aware of interpretative difficulties inherent to the CT examination of limb veins. We review the practical approach to DVT with CT venography on the basis of our experience with more than 800 combined examinations.;;;M
Circumflex femoral vein thrombosis misinterpreted as acute hamstring strain;;;Circumflex femoral vein thrombosis misinterpreted acute hamstring strain;;;The case of a 24-year-old female professional, long-distance runner who presented with acute proximal posterior thigh pain is reported. History and clinical findings were consistent with acute hamstring strain but MRI demonstrated circumflex femoral vein thrombosis. This is the first case of proximal posterior thigh pain caused by circumflex femoral vein thrombosis reported in the literature. Doctors dealing with sports injuries should be aware of this clinical entity that mimics hamstring strain.;;;M
Lower Extremity Venous Anatomy;;;Vein anatomy thrombosis valvular incompetence;;;The lower extremity venous system includes the superficial, deep, and perforating veins. The antegrade flow of blood within these veins is ensured by a system of muscular venous pumps and bicuspid valves. Dysfunction of the system may result from degeneration of the vein wall, post-thrombotic valvular damage, chronic venous obstruction, or dysfunction of the muscular pumps. Although chronic venous disease often receives less attention than arterial disease, it includes an array of manifestations resulting from a complex interaction of anatomy and hemodynamic failure. A thorough understanding of the highly variable venous anatomy is essential to understanding the underlying pathophysiology as well as in directing treatment.;;;M
“Bull's-eye” sign on gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance venography determines thrombus presence and age: A preliminary study;;;central thrombus gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance venography;;;Venous thrombosis is associated with a significant inflammatory response, which can be visualized by gadolinium magnetic resonance venography (MRV). Gadolinium extravasates into tissue during inflammation, producing perithrombus enhancement on magnetic resonance scanning. This study determines (1) whether gadolinium enhancement occurs during deep venous thrombosis (DVT); and (2) whether this enhancement changes with time and can therefore establish the age of thrombus.;;;M
Magnetic Resonance Imaging;;;pathologies exacerbating Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI;;;Stressful events have been implicated as being fundamental in provoking some pathologies and exacerbating the course or symptoms of others. In this regard, it has been suggested that certain pathological states, such as depressive and cardiovascular illness, may be related to antecedent stressors (or emotional states), although the biological outcomes leading to such effects remain to be fully deduced. The view has likewise been expressed that life-stressors (or depressive illness that might be associated with stressful events) may contribute to the exacerbation of neoplastic disease, although the available data in humans supporting this position has been limited, and the validity of this perspective has been challenged. Yet, treatment of depression in cancer patients as been found to increase survival times suggesting that psychological attributes, possibly involving stressor-related processes, may influence the course of cancer progression.;;;M
Nonlinear interaction of quadruple Gaussian laser beams with narrow band gap semiconductors;;;Quadruple Gaussian laser Nonlinear interaction Narrowband semiconductor;;;This paper presents an investigation on nonlinear propagation of quadruple Gaussian (Q.G) laser beam in narrowband semiconductor (e.g., n-type InSb) plasmas. In the presence of laser beam, the electron fluid in the conduction band becomes relativistic that makes the medium highly nonlinear. As a result the laser beam gets self-focused. Following variational theory approach in W.K.B approximation the numerical solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger wave equation (NSWE) for the field of incident laser beam has been obtained. Particular emphasis is put on dynamical variations of beam spot size and longitudinal phase (Gouy phase). Self-trapping of the laser beam resulting from the dynamical balance between diffraction broadening and nonlinear refraction also has been investigated.;;;SE

Physics of laser-driven plasma-based electron accelerators;;;Laser-driven Electron accelerators self-focusing high-quality;;;Laser-driven plasma-based accelerators, which are capable of supporting fields in excess of 100GV∕m, are reviewed. This includes the laser wakefield accelerator, the plasma beat wave accelerator, the self-modulated laser wakefield accelerator, plasma waves driven by multiple laser pulses, and highly nonlinear regimes. The properties of linear and nonlinear plasma waves are discussed, as well as electron acceleration in plasma waves. Methods for injecting and trapping plasma electrons in plasma waves are also discussed. Limits to the electron energy gain are summarized, including laser pulse diffraction, electron dephasing, laser pulse energy depletion, and beam loading limitations. The basic physics of laser pulse evolution in underdense plasmas is also reviewed. This includes the propagation, self-focusing, and guiding of laser pulses in uniform plasmas and with preformed density channels. Instabilities relevant to intense short-pulse laser-plasma interactions, such as Raman, self-modulation, and hose instabilities, are discussed. Experiments demonstrating key physics, such as the production of high-quality electron bunches at energies of 0.1–1GeV, are summarized.;;;SE
Enhanced focusing of laser beams in semiconductor plasmas;;;Copropagating laser beams Semiconductor plasmas Electrons ;;;The beating of two copropagating laser beams (having frequency difference, the plasma frequency) can resonantly excite a large amplitude plasma wave in a narrow-gap semiconductor [V. I. Berezhiani and S. M. Mahajan, Phys. Rev. B 55, 9247 (1997)]. The higher ponderomotive force on the electrons due to the plasma beat wave makes the medium highly nonlinear. As a result, the incident laser beams become self-focused due to the nonlinearity by the ponderomotive force. In this paper, we show the self-focusing and spot size evolution of the laser beams in semiconductor plasmas.;;;SE
The nonlinear wave in semiconductor quantum plasma for laser beam in a self-consistent plasma channel;;;Laser beam Plasma channel Self-focusing Beam power;;;In this paper investigating the current task, our emphasis is on distributed a serious laser beam in a self-made plasma channel. As the intensity of the laser beam increases, the medium displays the neuromuscular electrical conductivity functioning as a result of the mass effectiveness of the effectiveness of the electrons as well as the intensity of the electrons. Based on Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin and paraxial ray theory, the steady-state solution of an intense, Gaussian electromagnetic beam is studied. The differential equation of the distance with the beam width parameter is derived, including the relativistic effects of self-focusing (SF) and self-channeling ponder motive. Plasma propagation is a radial dynamical force, depending on the width of the beams and σp greater, plasma ratio frequency screws. Once the distribution regimes, the beam power beamwidth is obtained in plane. The σp is a particular value characterized by standard deviation, oscillation and diffusion regimes such as self focusing. The corresponding center parameters are intended for introduction of the plasma density curve and the laser beam is spatially analyzed to the spatial plasma. Performing this margin can lead to a long distance laser beam guide. The disadvantage of numerical predictions is done for laser plasma interaction studies for common factors.;;;SE
Intuitive explanation of the phase anomaly of focused light beams;;;Intuitive explanation phase anomaly focused light beams;;;An intuitive argument is presented for the phase anomaly, that is, the 180° phase shift of a light wave in passing through a focus. The treatment is based on the geometrical properties of Gaussian light beams, and suggests a new viewpoint for understanding the origin of the phase shift. Generalizing the argument by including higher-order modes of the light field allows the case of a spherical wave to be treated.;;;SE
Physical origin of the Gouy phase shift;;;Gouy phase shift axial propagation constant Kirchhoff diffraction integral;;;We show explicitly that the well-known Gouy phase shift of any focused beam originates from transverse spatial confinement, which, through the uncertainty principle, introduces a spread in the transverse momenta and hence a shift in the expectation value of the axial propagation constant. A general expression is given for the Gouy phase shift in terms of expectation values of the squares of the transverse momenta. Our result also explains the phase shift in front of the Kirchhoff diffraction integral.;;;SE
Optical beams in saturable self-focusing media;;;Saturable self-focusing media Beams propagating;;;An approximate analytical analysis of two-dimensional optical beams propagating in saturable self-focusing media is carried out. In particular, the radial shape and the phase shift of the stationary self-trapped fundamental mode are investigated in detail. The dynamic variations of the beamwidth and the phase shift for nonstationary propagation are also analyzed. The predictions of the analytical model are compared with numerical results for stationary propagation and show good agreement.;;;SE
Self-focusing and self-phase modulation in a parabolic graded-index optical fiber;;;Self-focusing Self-phase modulation Parabolic graded-index optical fiber;;;The spatial profile and the spectral distribution of a pulse propagating in a parabolic graded-index optical fiber are derived. Effects due to the nonlinearity (self-focusing and self-phase modulation), diffraction (finite beam-waist effects), and the graded-index waveguiding are incorporated in the theoretical analysis. The fiber graded index generates a periodicity in the beam diameter. Waveguiding, self-focusing, and diffraction determine the minimum magnitude of the beam-waist diameter. The pulse phase, amplitude shape, and spectral distribution are shown to differ from conventional self-phase modulation results.;;;SE
Self-Action of Laser Beams in Semiconductors;;;Self-Action Laser Beams in Semiconductors Nonlinear dielectric;;;We have derived an expression for the nonlinear dielectric constant due to nonparabolicity of the conduction band and energy-dependent scattering processes in semiconductors under the influence of an external laser beam. The self-action phenomenon due to the combined effect is then studied. The role of linear and nonlinear absorption coefficients is incorporated in the analysis of self-action to show that (i) the former leads to a lower threshold value of the incident power of the beam for self-focusing to occur, and (ii) the latter decreases the self-focusing length, the reduction being appreciable at optical frequencies. Some properties of the self-action phenomenon are then described in practical situations.;;;SE

It is found that the presence of transverse spatial dynamics leaves the phase characteristics qualitatively the same as for conventional self-phase modulation. In particular, this implies that, contrary to what has recently been claimed, the red always leads the blue in the supercontinuum.;;;SE
Generation of second harmonics of q-Gaussian laser beams in collisional plasma with upward density ramp;;;Laser beam collisional plasma hydrodynamic fluid model;;;An investigation of frequency up-conversion of a laser beam through the phenomenon of second harmonic generation (SHG) in collisional plasma with an upward density ramp is presented. The variational method has been adopted to find a semi-analytical solution of the wave equation for the slowly varying envelope of the laser beam. When a laser beam with frequency ω0 propagates through plasma it causes the plasma electrons to oscillate at pump frequency ω0. These oscillations of the plasma electrons in the presence of thermal velocity generate an electron plasma wave (EPW) at frequency ω0. The generated EPW beats with the pump beam to produce its second harmonics. By using a hydrodynamic fluid model of plasma, the source term for the SHG has been obtained. Emphasis is put on investigation of the effect of various laser and plasma parameters on the propagation dynamics of the pump beam and the conversion efficiency of second harmonics.;;;SE
Second harmonic generation of q-Gaussian laser beam in plasma channel created by ignitor heater technique;;;Harmonic generation plasma channel q-Gaussian self-focusing;;;This paper presents a scheme for second harmonic generation (SHG) of q-Gaussian laser beam in plasma channel created by ignitor heater technique. The ignitor beam creates plasma by tunnel ionization of air. The heater beam heats the plasma electrons and establishes a parabolic density profile. The third beam (q-Gaussian beam) is guided in this plasma channel under the combined effects of density nonuniformity of the plasma channel and relativistic mass nonlinearity of the plasma electrons. The propagation of q-Gaussian laser beam through the plasma channel excites an electron plasma wave at pump frequency that interacts with the incident laser beam to produce its second harmonics. The formulation is based on finding the numerical solution of the nonlinear Schrodinger wave equation for the fields of the incident laser beams with the help of moment theory approach. Particular emphasis is put on dynamical variations of the spot size of the laser beams and conversion efficiency of the second harmonics with distance of propagation.;;;SE
Self-focusing of super-Gaussian laser beam inmagnetized plasma under relativistic and ponderomotive regime;;;Nonlinear Schrödinger equation Modulational instability;;;In this paper, we have investigated the propagation characteristics of super-Gaussian laser beam in magnetized plasma. Self-focusing of short pulse laser propagating along the direction of ambient magnetic field in plasma is studied. The nonlinearity arises through the combined effect of relativistic mass variation and ponderomotive force induced electron cavitation. An appropriate nonlinear Schro¨dinger equation has been solved analytically using variational approach. Self-phase modulation is also studied under variety of parameters. Further, the effect of magnetic field on self-focusing of the beam have been explored.;;;SE
Second harmonic generation of self-focused Cosh-Gaussian laser beam in collisional plasma;;;Self-focusing Chromatic dispersion Cosh-Gaussian beam Collisional plasma Plasma wave;;;This paper presents theoretical investigation of effect of self-focusing of Cosh-Gaussian (ChG) laser beam on second harmonic generation (SHG) in collisional plasma. Due to non uniform intensity distribution along the wave front of ChG laser beam non uniform Ohmic heating of plasma electrons takes place. Non uniform heating of plasma the laser beam leads to self-focusing of the laser beam which in turn produces strong density gradients in the transverse direction. The generated density gradients excite electron plasma wave at pump frequency that interacts with the incident laser beam to produce its second harmonics. Following moment theory approach in Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin (W.K.B) approximation second order differential equation governing the evolution of spot size of laser beam with distance of propagation has been derived. Numerical simulations have been carried out to investigate the effect of laser intensity as well as plasma parameters on self-focusing of the laser beam and also on yield of second harmonics. Results predict that ChG laser beams show smaller divergence as they propagate and, thus, lead to enhanced conversion efficiency of second harmonics.;;;SE
Non-oscillation of modified Euler type linear and half-linear differential equations;;;Euler Non-oscillation half-linear differential equations;;;Modified Euler type second order half-linear differential equations are considered and a non-oscillation criterion is derived for them. This criterion is the counterpart of a previously obtained oscillation theorem. Thus, from the main result of this paper, it follows that the studied equations are conditionally oscillatory in a very general case. To prove the non-oscillation criterion, a combination of the Riccati technique and the generalized Prüfer angle is used. Since the criterion is new in many cases (especially, in the linear case), several corollaries are formulated and the novelty is illustrated by an example as well.;;;SE
Oscillation theory for second order linear, half-linear, superlinear and sublinear dynamic equations. ;;;oscillation and nonoscillation linear differential equations half-linear differential equations sub- and superlinear differential equations asymptotic behavior; continuation; boundedness;;;There has been a striking progress in the development of the theory of oscillations after the excellent book on the subject by [C. A. Swanson, Comparison and oscillation theory of linear differential equations. New York-London: Academic Press, (1968; Zbl 0191.09904)] was published. The monograph under review is a very successful attempt to collect and systematically present numerous oscillation or nonoscillation criteria for various classes of linear and nonlinear differential equations and related results on asymptotic behavior of solutions published during the last few decades, many of which have been obtained by the authors. The material in the book is divided into ten chapters. In Chapter 1, which has an auxiliary character, sufficient conditions for solutions of a general class of nonlinear differential equations to be continuable, bounded, and converge to zero are presented along with a number of useful fixed-point theorems. Fundamental results on oscillation and nonoscillation of second-order linear differential equations, including Sturm-type comparison theorems, are collected in Chapter 2. Oscillation and nonoscillation theorems for second-order half-linear differential equations are presented in Chapter 3, where the reader can find Sturm- and Levin-type comparison theorems, an oscillation criterion for almost-periodic Sturm-Liouville equations, interval oscillation criteria, as well as a number of interesting results dealing with differential equations with a damping term, external forces and deviating argument. Sufficient conditions for oscillation and sufficient and necessary conditions for nonoscillation of superlinear differential equations, including damped and forced differential equations, can be found in Chapter 4. In addition to standard techniques involving integrals and weighted integrals, more general weighted and iterated averages are employed.;;;SE

Dynamic equations on time scales. An introduction with applications.;;;measure chain generalized derivative dynamic equations;;;The theory of time scales (an alternative terminology is measure chains) was introduced by S. Hilger in 1988 in his dissertation and the basic ideas of this theory are summarized in his paper published in Result. Math. 18, No. 1/2, 18–56 (1990; Zbl 0722.39001). A time scale TT is any closed subset of the real numbers RR. For a function f:T→Rf:T→R, a generalized derivative fΔfΔ is defined in such a way that it reduces to the usual derivative f′f′ if T=RT=R and to the forward difference ΔfΔf if T=ZT=Z is the set of integers. A dynamic equation on a time scale is an equation for an unknown function which appears in the equation along with some of its derivatives (possibly of higher order). Hence, dynamic equations are differential equations if R=TR=T and difference equations if T=ZT=Z.;;;SE

This covers (among others) broad range of equations with periodic, almost periodic and asymptotically almost periodic coefficients. The main interest is in the case on the tenuous boundary between the oscillatory and nonoscillatory case. In this case the rough comparison methods and other widely used techniques cannot be used and a more advanced approach is necessary. Therefore, the equation studied in the paper has somewhat special form.;;;SE

Non-Oscillation of half-linear difference equations with asymptotically periodic coefficients;;;oscillatory properties half-linear difference equations asymptotically periodic coefficients;;;We study oscillatory properties of half-linear difference equations with asymptotically periodic coefficients, i.e., coefficients which can be expressed as the sums of periodic sequences and sequences vanishing at infinity. Using a special variation of the discrete Riccati technique, we prove that the non-oscillation of the studied equations can be determined directly from their coefficients. Thus, the studied equations can be widely used as testing equations. Our main result is new even for linear equations with periodic coefficients. This fact is illustrated by simple corollaries and examples at the end of this paper.;;;SE

Using a method whose core is formed by the Prüfer technique, we identify a borderline case between oscillatory and non-oscillatory equations. Moreover, we are able to decide whether the studied equations are oscillatory or not even in the so-called critical (i.e., the borderline) case. The advantage of our approach is the fact that we obtain new and strong results for linear and half-linear equations (i.e., the equations with the one-dimensional p-Laplacian) at the same time. In addition, we are able to work with equations whose coefficients are non-constant and non-periodic. The novelty of our results is documented by examples and corollaries.;;;SE

In addition, our approach enables to analyse also the oscillatory properties of equations whose coefficients are not given by sequences with mean values. We point out that the obtained results are new even for linear equations with periodic coefficients. Such consequences are formulated at the end of this paper.;;;SE

Nonuniqueness and Existence of Continuous, Globally Dissipative Euler Flows;;;Globally Dissipative Euler Flows Energy space Kraichnan’s LDIA theory;;;We show that Hölder continuous incompressible Euler flows that satisfy the local energy inequality (“globally dissipative” solutions) exhibit nonuniqueness and contain examples that strictly dissipate kinetic energy. The collection of such solutions emanating from a fixed initial data may have positive Hausdorff dimension in the energy space even if the local energy equality is imposed, and the set of initial data giving rise to such an infinite family of solutions in the space of continuous, divergence free vector fields on the torus. The construction of these solutions involves a new and explicit convex integration approach mirroring Kraichnan’s LDIA theory of turbulent energy cascades that overcomes the limitations of previous schemes, which had been restricted to bounded measurable solutions or to continuous solutions that dissipate total kinetic energy.;;;SE
Anomalous dissipation for 1/51/5-Hölder Euler flows;;;Kolmogorov's law Onsager's conjecture anomalous dissipation convex integration h-principle turbulent flows;;;Recently the second and fourth authors developed an iterative scheme for obtaining rough solutions of the 3D incompressible Euler equations in Hölder spaces. The motivation comes from Onsager’s conjecture. The construction involves a superposition of weakly interacting perturbed Beltrami flows on infinitely many scales. An obstruction to better regularity arises from the errors in the linear transport of a fast periodic flow by a slow velocity field. In a recent paper the third author has improved upon the methods, introducing some novel ideas on how to deal with this obstruction, thereby reaching a better Hölder exponent — albeit weaker than the one conjectured by Onsager. ;;;SE

Moreover, we also show that weak solutions of the dissipative SQG equation are not unique, even if the fractional dissipation is stronger than the square root of the Laplacian. In view of the results of Marchand in 2008, we establish that for the dissipative SQG equation, weak solutions may be constructed in the same function space both via classical weak compactness arguments and via convex integration. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.;;;SE
Onsager’s Conjecture Almost Everywhere in Time;;;Hölder continuous Euler flows conjecture of Lars Onsager;;;In recent works by Isett (Hölder continuous Euler flows in three dimensions with compact support in time, pp 1–173, 2012), and later by Buckmaster et al. (Ann Math 2015), iterative schemes were presented for constructing solutions belonging to the Hölder class C 1/5-ε of the 3D incompressible Euler equations which do not conserve the total kinetic energy. The cited work is partially motivated by a conjecture of Lars Onsager in 1949 relating to the existence of C 1/3-ε solutions to the Euler equations which dissipate energy. In this note we show how the later scheme can be adapted in order to prove the existence of non-trivial Hölder continuous solutions which for almost every time belong to the critical Onsager Hölder regularity C 1/3-ε and have compact temporal support.;;;SE
Nonuniqueness of weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation;;;convex integration Euler equations Intermittency inviscid limit Navier-Stokes turbulence weak solutions;;;For initial datum of finite kinetic energy, Leray has proven in 1934 that there exists at least one global in time finite energy weak solution of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper we prove that weak solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations are not unique in the class of weak solutions with finite kinetic energy. Moreover, we prove that Hölder continuous dissipative weak solutions of the 3D Euler equations may be obtained as a strong vanishing viscosity limit of a sequence of finite energy weak solutions of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations.;;;SE

Using the techniques introduced in De Lellis and Székelyhidi (Inventiones Mathematicae 9:377–407, 2013; Dissipative Euler flows and Onsager’s conjecture, 2012), we prove the existence of infinitely many (Hölder) continuous initial vector fields starting from which there exist infinitely many (Hölder) continuous solutions with preassigned total kinetic energy.;;;SE
An Onsager singularity theorem for Leray solutions of incompressible Navier–Stokes;;;Leray solutions Besov space conserve energy Euler solutions;;;We study in the inviscid limit the global energy dissipation of Leray solutions of incompressible Navier–Stokes on the torus , assuming that the solutions have norms for Besov space   that are bounded in the L3-sense in time, uniformly in viscosity. We establish an upper bound on energy dissipation of the form  vanishing as  if  A consequence is that Onsager-type 'quasi-singularities' are required in the Leray solutions, even if the total energy dissipation vanishes in the limit , as long as it does so sufficiently slowly. We also give two sufficient conditions which guarantee the existence of limiting weak Euler solutions u which satisfy a local energy balance with possible anomalous dissipation due to inertial-range energy cascade in the Leray solutions. For  the anomalous dissipation vanishes and the weak Euler solutions may be spatially 'rough' but conserve energy.;;;SE
MINIMAL ENTROPY CONDITIONS FOR BURGERS EQUATION;;;uniformly convex entropy Kruzhkov solution Hamilton-Jacobi equation;;;We consider uniformly convex, 1−d scalar conservation laws. We show that a single uniformly convex entropy is sufficient to characterize a Kruzhkov solution. The proof uses the concept of viscosity solution for the related Hamilton-Jacobi equation.;;;SE
The Euler equations as a differential inclusion;;;Euler equations turbulence weak solutions;;;We propose a new point of view on weak solutions of the Euler equations, describing the motion of an ideal incompressible fluid in RnRn with n≥2n≥2. We give a reformulation of the Euler equations as a differential inclusion, and in this way we obtain transparent proofs of several celebrated results of V. Scheffer and A. Shnirelman concerning the non-uniqueness of weak solutions and the existence of energy-decreasing solutions. Our results are stronger because they work in any dimension and yield bounded velocity and pressure.;;;SE
On Admissibility Criteria for Weak Solutions of the Euler Equations;;;Euler Equations local energy inequalities p-system Eulerian coordinates;;;We consider solutions to the Cauchy problem for the incompressible Euler equations satisfying several additional requirements, like the global and local energy inequalities. Using some techniques introduced in an earlier paper, we show that, for some bounded compactly supported initial data, none of these admissibility criteria singles out a unique weak solution. As a byproduct, in more than one space dimension, we show bounded initial data for which admissible solutions to the p-system of isentropic gas dynamics in Eulerian coordinates are not unique.;;;SE
The h-principle and the equations of fluid dynamics;;;Euler equations h-principle fluid dynamics ;;;In this note we survey some recent results for the Euler equations in compressible and incompressible fluid dynamics. The main point of all these theorems is the surprising fact that a suitable variant of Gromov’s h-principle holds in several cases.;;;SE
Inertial energy dissipation for weak solutions of incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations;;;Inertial energy dissipation Navier-Stokes equations Euler equation;;;We study the local equation of energy for weak solutions of three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes and Euler equations. We define a dissipation term D (u ) which stems from an eventual lack of smoothness in the solution u . We give in passing a simple proof of Onsager's conjecture on energy conservation for the three-dimensional Euler equation, slightly weakening the assumption of Constantin et al . We suggest calling weak solutions with non-negative D (u ) `dissipative'.;;;SE
Non-uniqueness and h-Principle for Hölder-Continuous Weak Solutions of the Euler Equations;;;h-Principle for Hölder-Continuous Euler Equations Reynolds stress tensor;;;In this paper we address the Cauchy problem for the incompressible Euler equations in the periodic setting. We prove that the set of Hölder 1/5−ε1/5−ε wild initial data is dense in L2L2, where we call an initial datum wild if it admits infinitely many admissible Hölder 1/5−ε1/5−ε weak solutions. We also introduce a new set of stationary flows which we use as a perturbation profile instead of Beltrami flows in order to show that a general form of the h-principle applies to Hölder-continuous weak solutions of the Euler equations. Our result indicates that in a deterministic theory of three dimensional turbulence the Reynolds stress tensor can be arbitrary and need not satisfy any additional closure relation.;;;SE
Onsager and the theory of hydrodynamic turbulence;;;International Center for Theoretical Physics Trieste Italy and Institute for Physical Science and Technology University of Maryland College Park, Maryland 20742 USA;;;Lars Onsager, a giant of twentieth-century science and the 1968 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, made deep contributions to several areas of physics and chemistry. Perhaps less well known is his ground-breaking work and lifelong interest in the subject of hydrodynamic turbulence. He wrote two papers on the subject in the 1940s, one of them just a short abstract. Unbeknownst to Onsager, one of his major results was derived a few years earlier by A. N. Kolmogorov, but Onsager’s work contains many gems and shows characteristic originality and deep understanding. His only full-length article on the subject in 1949 introduced two novel ideas—negative-temperature equilibria for two-dimensional ideal fluids and an energy-dissipation anomaly for singular Euler solutions—that stimulated much later work. However, a study of Onsager’s letters to his peers around that time, as well as his private papers of that period and the early 1970s, shows that he had much more to say about the problem than he published. Remarkably, his private notes of the 1940s contain the essential elements of at least four major results that appeared decades later in the literature: (1) a mean-field Poisson-Boltzmann equation and other thermodynamic relations for point vortices; (2) a relation similar to Kolmogorov’s 4∕5 law connecting singularities and dissipation; (3) the modern physical picture of spatial intermittency of velocity increments, explaining anomalous scaling of the spectrum; and (4) a spectral turbulence closure quite similar to the modern eddy-damped quasinormal Markovian equations. This paper is a summary of Onsager’s published and unpublished contributions to hydrodynamic turbulence and an account of their place in the field as the subject has evolved through the years. A discussion is also given of the historical context of the work, especially of Onsager’s interactions with his contemporaries who were acknowledged experts in the subject at the time. Finally, a brief speculation is offered as to why Onsager may have chosen not to publish several of his significant results.;;;SE
